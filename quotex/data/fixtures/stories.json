Coe State Park, near San Jose, will be sparred from closure thanks to a million dollars raised by the nonprofit Coe Park Preservation Fund.\" longdesc=\"Bruce Hamilton, Bay Nature\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/4/park-closures/original/captionimage_mainarticle.jpeg\" alt=\"Park Closures\" />In the first few months after California announced its park closures in May 2011, park advocates were stunned and outraged. The state was tearing down 25 percent of a world-renowned system\u201570 parks in all. Almost a year later, the state parks closure cloud still looms, big and black. But dozens of small victories and individual acts of courage are adding a silver lining.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The good news started with some wins last year. A handful of beach lovers and staff at&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=24215\" target=\"_blank\">McGrath State Beach</a></span>&nbsp;near Ventura raised half a million dollars for the new sewage system that is keeping that park open. And a nonprofit, the&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.coeparkfund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Coe Park Preservation Fund</a></span>, raised more than a million dollars to protect its namesake park near San Jose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Institutional neighbors stepped up, too. The National Park Service has pledged to keep Tomales Bay, Samuel P. Taylor, and Del Norte Coast Redwoods state parks open for at least a year. Counties and cities have offered to provide services at parks within their borders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&ldquo;People are beginning to be mobilized in a way they haven&rsquo;t before,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.calparks.org/\" target=\"_blank\">California State Parks Foundation</a></span>&nbsp;president Elizabeth Goldstein.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">At the same time, promising and dedicated grassroots leaders have emerged. To name a few: Greg Hayes, a former state park superintendent, has forsaken retirement to try to rescue Jack London Historic State Park; Kathy Bailey, a longtime resident of Northern California&rsquo;s Anderson Valley, is devoting her days to working with her neighbors to keep Hendy Woods State Park open; Robert Hanna, not long ago a sales manager in a financial firm, has teamed up with activists at several state parks to &ldquo;do everything I can to help keep parks open.&rdquo; Perhaps Hanna was destined to be a leader; he is John Muir&rsquo;s 31-year-old great-great grandson. Somehow this crisis has led him and dozens of other Californians to a new calling: preserving state parks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Inside and outside the bureaucracy, the crisis has highlighted some not-so-new ideas.&nbsp;At&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=469\" target=\"_blank\">Samuel P. Taylor State Park</a></span>, in Marin, supervising ranger Rose Blackburn is reassessing her use of volunteer campground hosts. In exchange for free RV space, they work 20 hours a week helping park visitors and handling emergencies. In peak season, she now has two campground hosts and may expand that to three or four, with one host concentrating on maintenance. One surefire revenue enhancement at Taylor is a new lodging option: five new primitive cabins that she hopes will be ready for visitors this summer, at $100 a night or so (compared with $35 for a campsite).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In the past, some parks neglected collecting fees, partly because the revenue went to Sacramento to be shared among all the parks. Now new models are being explored. At Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve, for example, the nonprofit Bodie Foundation&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/12/01/BAVQ1M76SB.DTL\" target=\"_blank\">will collect a $3 parking fee</a></span>&nbsp;to be invested right back into Mono.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Save the Redwoods League&rsquo;s&nbsp;&nbsp;executive director Ruskin Hartley said basic entry fees to state parks should be kept low to ensure people can afford to visit, \"but&nbsp;that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should pay the same amount to camp on July 4<span class=\"s1\">th</span>&nbsp;as you would on January 4<span class=\"s1\">th.</span>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In Sonoma, the county parks department and the nonprofit organization&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.landpaths.org/\" target=\"_blank\">LandPaths</a></span>&nbsp;hope to build support by reintroducing parks to local communities in places like Annadel State Park.&nbsp;<img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; float: right; width: 50%;\" longdesc=\"Joan Hamilton, Bay Nature\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/4/park-closures-2/original/tree%2520coe.jpeg\" alt=\"Park closures 2\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;d start by bringing out kids from every single school in Santa Rosa within walking distance,&rdquo; said LandPaths&rsquo; executive director Craig Anderson . &ldquo;We&rsquo;d see if senior communities could have picnics at the trailhead. We&rsquo;d see if we could entice the 30-somethings with something kind of edgy and fresh.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The Napa County parks department has suggested pooling government resources to run parks more efficiently. For example, the county sheriff might set up a substation on state park land in exchange for keeping an eye on Bothe-Napa State Park. Cities and counties have also offered to help with trash pickup and other services on state park lands near facilities they already manage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The state Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office (LAO) also had efficiency in mind&nbsp;when it&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/laoapp/PubDetails.aspx?id=2588\" target=\"_blank\">challenged a rule</a></span>&nbsp;requiring all state park rangers to have peace-officer (police) training. As a March 2012 LAO report states, &ldquo;While some ranger duties, such as responding to emergencies and making arrests, require peace officer status, many of them do not (such as managing staff, providing information to visitors, and leading school groups on tours).&rdquo; Reducing the number of peace officers could reduce state parks&rsquo; expenses by at least a few million dollars, the report said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">A few additional millions could be garnered by the passage of the California State Parks Stewardship Act of 2012, A.B. 1589. Introduced by Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) in February, the bill would allow residents to buy an annual state park pass when filing tax returns, and introduces a special state park license plate. It also sets up a fund that would pool $25 million in unused bond money to pay for the&nbsp;<span class=\"s2\">installation of revenue and fee collection equipment and technologies to increase park visitation and revenues, among other measures. The bill&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://asmdc.org/members/a06/news-room/press-releases/item/3175-committee-approves-huffman-bill-to-save-state-parks\" target=\"_blank\">passed out</a></span>&nbsp;of its first committee unanimously last week.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">This is just a small sampling of the promising ideas that have emerged in the past few months. They are not enough to counter the problems that will arise from the state&rsquo;s meat-ax approach to budget cutting. Dozens of parks are expected to close on July 1, and they will be damaged\u2015perhaps permanently. The jury is still out on whether closures&nbsp;&nbsp;will actually save money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">But the shock of closures has also had its benefits, moving California toward&nbsp;&nbsp;more government&nbsp;&nbsp;cooperation, energized nonprofit leadership, and generous private contributions of time and money. The parks idea of the early 20<span class=\"s1\">th</span>&nbsp;century is being updated for the 21st century with broad, sometimes angry, but decidedly engaged public participation. People are joining their neighbors. They&rsquo;re reconnecting with their parks.</p>\r\n</div>", "slug": "advocates-use-creative-solutions-keep", "title": "Creative Solutions Keep Some State Parks Open"}}, {"pk": 13662, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>Federal agents on Monday morning raided several properties owned by Richard Lee, the leader of the marijuana legalization movement in California, sources told The Bay Citizen.

McCormick was arrested for growing pot soon after the state legalized medical marijuana in 1996 and currently grows put for patients, sources said.</p>\r\n<p>Agents entered Lee's home with guns early Monday morning, said Dale Sky Jones, chancellor of Oaksterdam. Lee, who uses a wheelchair, was detained for a few hours Monday morning at his home and then released, sources said. Four marijuana nursery workers were detained at Oaksterdam. Barnes confirmed that five people were detained, but said that no arrests were made.</p>\r\n<p>The raids come as Lee's battle with U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag escalated. Last fall, Haag ordered Lee's dispensary, Coffeeshop Blue Sky to move because it was too close to a school, as the Bay Citizen first reported. But instead of closing the dispensary, as many other pot club owners have done,&nbsp;Lee moved it first two doors down and then later into the building where the Oaksterdam museum is located.</p>\r\n<p>Barnes declined to offer further comment, saying the warrants were under seal.</p>\r\n<p>Protesters gathered outside Oaksterdam as the operation continued into the late morning. They chanted \"Free Richard Lee\" and screamed in the faces of the agents. One even called the Oakland Police Department to report that a robbery was in progress at the university.</p>\r\n<p>Jason Overman, an aide to Oakland City Councilwoman Rebecca Kaplan, denounced the raids outside the university.</p>\r\n<p>\"If the federal government has extra resources in Oakland, then they should use them to get the illegal guns off the streets that are actually killing people,\" Overman said.</p>\r\n<p>Steve DeAngelo, who runs Harborside Health Center, the largest dispensary in Oakland arrived on the scene to lend support to his sometime rival Lee. He said the raids were purely political, targeting Lee because he had led the effort to legalize marijuana in 2010 with Prop. 19.</p>\r\n<p>\"They can't say they're going after a criminal,\" DeAngelo said. \"They're going after a voice of change.

When the County opens health centers on or near school campuses, they are reimbursed for most of the services they provide.</p>\r\n<p>Students get services including mental health counseling, physical exams, sports physicals, first aid, vaccinations, dental screenings and treatment, STD screening and treatment and health education about nutrition, fitness, puberty and sexual health at the clinics. Clinic staff also enrolls students in insurance programs and refers them to providers off-site.</p>\r\n<p>Twenty years ago, studies showed adolescents among the least likely to have access to health care and having the lowest rates of primary care use of any age group in the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to put it where they&rsquo;ll trip over it,&rdquo; Clayton said.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s what schools, public entities and non-profits have done over the past three decades, starting with teen health centers in high schools that offered preventative health services. Healthy Start began making grants to hundreds of schools for school-based services in the 1990s.</p>\r\n<p>Now there is a more unified effort to provide comprehensive primary care on or near school campuses. All 26 school-based health centers in Alameda County are built and funded through the county, but run by community health clinics.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They are not just a clinic in a school, they are part of a broader healthcare system,&rdquo; Briscoe said.</p>\r\n<p>Serena Clayton says school-based health centers provide a unique value to the healthcare system. &ldquo;They can monitor chronic disease on a daily basis,&rdquo; Clayton said. &ldquo;They can do education in a way no one else can&mdash;in a classroom 1-on-1 with students.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Gone are the days of a school nurse sitting in an office waiting to give a student a band-aid. &ldquo;We have one of the lowest school nurse ratios in the country,&rdquo; Clayton said. Today, school nurses are integrating into school-based health centers.</p>\r\n<p>The Oakland-based Native American Health Center is involved in six school-based health clinics, two of which they run. Nurse practitioner Bonnie Trinclisti runs the Native American Health Center&rsquo;s Adolescent Program. Over the past twenty years, she&rsquo;s seen Oakland&rsquo;s school-based health centers grow from four nurse stations to 26 clinics.</p>\r\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>She spends half her time administering the program and half her time meeting kids in 15-minute blocks at the school-based health centers. &ldquo;I do primary care &mdash; a lot of reproductive health,&rdquo; said Trinclisti.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The biggest barrier to care for kids is their parents,&rdquo; Trinclisti said. She says it is difficult for parents to take a day off of work to take their child to the doctor off-site. But once kids are in middle or high school, they don&rsquo;t need a parent with them at their appointments.</p>\r\n<p>Providing mental health services is the biggest challenge at the clinics. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get anybody to pay for them,&rdquo; Trinclisti said. &ldquo;Mental health is more needed than any other single support for kids in schools.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The unmet needs for mental health services and dental access have been the largest complaints about the health care system over the years, Serena Clayton said. Recently, there&rsquo;s been more funding for dental programs, primarily for prevention, screening, varnish and sealants.</p>\r\n<p>School-based health centers, Clayton said, are the epitome of the principals of health care reform&mdash;to transform the way health care is delivered through inexpensive preventative care. Little of the funding for school-based clinics, however, came from the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n<p>The Affordable Care Act did provide $100 million for significant and pressing capital needs to improve delivery and support expansion of services at school-based health centers in 2011. The Health Resources and Services Administration awarded a total of $1.2 million in Alameda County to the Oakland Unified School District, Alameda County Health Care Services Agency, Native American Health Center and Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Right now it&rsquo;s a little drip in a big ocean,&rdquo; Bonnie Trinclisti said.</p>\r\n<p>A $399,260 grant to the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency covered some furniture and equipment expenses. A $423,098 grant went to Oakland Unified School District to add an additional portable to the clinic at Oakland Technical High School, doubling their square footage.</p>\r\n<p>The grant will also make it possible for an East Oakland-based community clinic, La Clincia De La Raza, to switch to electronic health records (EHR) at the five school-based health centers they run. All clinics will be expected to switch to EHR by the time health care reform is fully implemented in 2014.</p>\r\n<p>The development of school-based health centers is more of a locally funded effort with $14 million of the $18 million initiative in Oakland coming from voter approved school bonds, Alex Briscoe said.</p>\r\n<p>Serena Clayton originally hoped that the Affordable Care Act would support ongoing operations at the clinics. Support for those expenses are included in the legislation but the funding was not approved.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like an empty shell that&rsquo;s sitting there,&rdquo; Clayton said of the ACA.</p>\r\n<p>She is holding out hope that the next $100 million to be released in the spring will be authorized to fund ongoing operations.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, people like Bonnie Trinclisti will continue to piece together whatever funding is available, mostly from Medi-Cal reimbursements and billing for services.</p>", "slug": "oakland-schools-want-provide-primary-all", "title": "Oakland Schools Want to Provide Health Care to All Students"}}, {"pk": 13664, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; width: 100%;\" longdesc=\"TREASURES FROM THE MUNI ARCHIVE at THE SAN FRANCISCO RAILWAY MUSEUM, streetcar.org; Adithya Sambamurthy/The Bay Citizen\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/muni-then-and-now/original/Muni%20J-L-N.jpg\" alt=\"Muni Then and Now\" /></p>\r\n<p>The San Francisco Muni is turning 100 this year. And in that century of great technological progress, in which an aircraft broke the sound barrier in 1947  and a supersonic car did the same in 1997,  Muni has actually become slower.</p>\r\n<p>In 1920, the F-Stockton streetcar carried passengers from the Financial District at Market and Stockton Streets all the way to the Marina at Chestnut and Scott Streets in a zippy 17 minutes. Today a very similar trip on the 30-Stockton, the successor to the F-Stockton, takes a half-hour if the stars are properly aligned.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Streetcars ruled the road, and there wasn&rsquo;t much getting in the way &mdash; no car traffic &mdash; and we didn&rsquo;t have all the traffic lights and stop signs,&rdquo; said Peter Straus, a retired Muni service planner. &ldquo;Back then it was basically &lsquo;load and go,&rsquo;&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and there was nothing to slow them down.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>San Franciscans were not shocked to learn that Muni ran faster 100 years ago.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a horse-drawn carriage got there faster than Muni,&rdquo; Angie Murphy, a regular Muni commuter, said recently as she waited for a bus in the rain in the Financial District.</p>\r\n<p>Muni was born in 1912 as the Municipal Railway, with a streetcar line, the A and B, which eventually ran from the ferries to the beach. An excited crowd of 50,000 celebrated the inauguration in downtown San Francisco.</p>\r\n<p>Before that, private companies had operated streetcars here and all over the United States. But San Franciscans, angered by corruption and demonstrating their independence from the status quo even a century ago, voted for a $2 million bond to build the first piece of the publicly owned &ldquo;people&rsquo;s railway.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In 1920, the B line, replaced by the busy 38-Geary in 1956, departed from the spot where the ferry building stands today and zoomed out to near Ocean Beach in 35 minutes. The fare was a nickel.</p>\r\n<p>Today a similar $2 trip on the 38-Geary takes 54 minutes, while the 38 Limited, which makes fewer stops, takes 43 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the early Muni lines were faster because of &ldquo;less competition for street space &mdash; there was no surface traffic, and the streetcars would fly through,&rdquo; said Rick Laubscher, president of Market Street Railway, a nonprofit group dedicated to preserving Muni&rsquo;s history.</p>\r\n<p>An archivist for the organization, which is exhibiting photos of Muni&rsquo;s centennial at the San Francisco Railway Museum, provided travel times dating back to 1920.</p>\r\n<p>Building the Market Street subway in 1980 was supposed to speed the streetcars that traveled on crowded Market Street before heading off to the foggy outer limits of the city. But even lines that now use the tunnel, like the N-Judah and the L-Taraval, have not become faster over the past century.</p>\r\n<p>The popular N-Judah, born in 1928 with the opening of the Sunset Tunnel, made it from the ferries to Ocean Beach in 33.5 minutes more than 80 years ago. Today the same trip is scheduled at 38 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>The L-Taraval, which runs underground for 5.5 miles from the Embarcadero station before emerging at the West Portal station, now takes 36 minutes to take passengers out to the zoo, the same as it did in 1939.</p>\r\n<p>Riders of the K-Ingleside and the J-Church, at least, have reason to rejoice. Both lines have sped up three minutes since 1920, although the J-Church is still chugging along at its 1939 rate.</p>\r\n<p>Commuters pining for the quick old days of Muni may soon get some relief. Officials at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency are preparing a plan to speed several routes, including the 30, the J and the N.</p>\r\n<p>This is scheduled to be done by removing stop signs, programming traffic signals so they stay green for buses, creating additional bus-only traffic lanes and removing some bus stops. The plan is known as the Transit Effectiveness Project.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have a pretty good sense of different things we can do to speed up the transit service,&rdquo; said Ed Reiskin, head of the transportation agency.</p>\r\n<p>The steps Muni is taking, Reiskin added, &ldquo;are going to help us reverse that trend and get us back to even better than where we were 100 years ago.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>To see photographs, put cursor on vertical bar in the center and move it to the left or right.</strong></p>\r\n<p>%32536%</p>", "slug": "after-100-years-muni-runs-slower", "title": "After 100 Years, Muni Runs Slower"}}, {"pk": 13665, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><em>Despite street signs that point out the Nourse Auditorium, few walking past the hulking building at Hayes and Franklin Streets know about the opulent 1,800-seat theater inside.

We can barely keep it stocked with cats.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of people, for whatever reason, they won&rsquo;t go to a shelter,&rdquo; said Mike Murray, director of community outreach for Pet Food Express. &ldquo;They just feel like there&rsquo;s bad things happening there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Cat adoptions are up over all. The city said 536 cats had been adopted out of shelters since last fall, plus 146 from the Pet Food Express site. Over the same period last year, only 349 cats found homes.</p>\r\n<p>Pet Food Express operates similar in-store adoption sites in cooperation with other agencies in three other stores around the Bay Area. In total, they say that around 1,000 cats and kittens have been adopted from their stores.</p>\r\n<p>Collaborations between pet stores and animal shelters are not new; adoption days happen regularly at both chain and independent stores. But Katz said that her department had been careful to form partnerships with pet stores that do not traffic in animals, because that would conflict with Animal Care and Control&rsquo;s policy. Pet Food Express, a business that got its start in San Francisco, is firm in its commitment to sell only pet products.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>But that does not mean that opening the cat adoption center is &ldquo;100 percent altruistic,&rdquo; Katz said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;People are right there to buy food and bedding and treats,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;So of course it&rsquo;s a win for them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Murray echoed the observation.

Lee and his top campaign contributor, the Silicon Valley investor Ron Conway, met for a two-hour dinner at Caf&eacute; des Amis in San Francisco&rsquo;s tony Marina District.</p>\r\n<p>The topic, as Mr. Conway described it: how to &ldquo;preserve the momentum&rdquo; of the independent expenditure committees for which the investor had raised $600,000 to help elect Mr. Lee. The outcome of the dinner was the San Francisco <a href=\"http://sfciti.com/\">Citizens Initiative for Technology &amp; Innovation</a>, or sf.citi, a nonprofit technology business league with the goal of helping to lure technology companies to San Francisco.</p>\r\n<p>Five months after the election, however, questions have been raised about Mr. Lee&rsquo;s actions on behalf of companies in which Mr. Conway has a financial interest. The mayor&rsquo;s actions follow a controversy in 2011 in which Mr. Lee, while serving as interim mayor, helped steer local tax breaks to Twitter and Zynga, two other companies backed by Mr. Conway.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Lee told The Bay Citizen that he has intervened to attempt to prevent the city&rsquo;s tax collector from charging a 14 percent hotel tax on short-term apartment rentals arranged by the online booking agency Airbnb, a company that received major backing from Mr. Conway&rsquo;s SV Angel investment firm. And Mr. Lee&rsquo;s staff has moved to help another company backed by Mr. Conway, Square, which makes a device that allows users to collect credit card payments on their smartphones. Mr. Lee said his office has intervened to keep the city&rsquo;s taxi regulators from banning the device, which the regulators contend may be viewed with suspicion by passengers.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is less about Ron Conway and more about sf.citi and how we can help companies that are giving back to San Francisco,&rdquo; Mr. Lee said.</p>\r\n<p>Tony Winnicker, an adviser to Mr. Lee who served as his campaign spokesman, said the mayor made support for local technology investments a key part of his 2011 campaign message, and that aiding local startups is a matter of following through on a promise to voters. As of late 2011, a document obtained by The Bay Citizen revealed, Mr. Conway&rsquo;s SV Angel firm has or had investments in 69 San Francisco-based companies. Mr. Winnicker said it would be impossible to pursue a local tech-industry policy without somehow benefiting Mr. Conway&rsquo;s investments. Other investors in his SV Angel funds include former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We make no apologies,&rdquo; Mr. Winnicker said. &ldquo;Lee is following through on what he promised he would do as mayor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Critics, however, contend that this is an example of how Mr. Lee&rsquo;s actions demonstrate his lack of independence from his political backers. Mr. Conway is a Republican. Mr. Lee is a Democrat.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a distinct difference between pursuing policies that raise the tide for everybody and pay-to-play politics to reward one particular supporter&rsquo;s investment,&rdquo; said Aaron Peskin, a former Board of Supervisors president who is now head of the local Democratic Party. &ldquo;This is about rewarding a major campaign contributor. It&rsquo;s pay-to-play politics pure and simple.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Winnicker said he &ldquo;vehemently&rdquo; disagreed that Mr. Lee&rsquo;s actions amounted to &ldquo;pay for play.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Corey Cook, an assistant professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, said it was not unusual for politicians to find backers in industries they support. But, Cook said, the mayor&rsquo;s close ties to Conway could harm him politically.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that Lee risks violating ethics standards,&rdquo; Cook said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that he feeds into the perception that he&rsquo;s not an independent politician.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On March 12, San Francisco&rsquo;s treasurer and tax collector posted on the agency Web site a rule specifying that online brokers who help people rent their rooms to vacation travelers must pay the city&rsquo;s 14 percent hotel occupancy tax. The obscure-seeming rule was of keen interest to Airbnb, the leader in this nascent business, which employs 125 people at its San Francisco headquarters.</p>\r\n<p>Later in the month, an employee of Conway&rsquo;s SV Angel investment firm sent an e-mail to local technology firms urging them to send employees to a hearing about the rule.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Last Tuesday, Lee announced the formation of a &ldquo;Sharing Economy Working Group,&rdquo; which the mayor said in an interview had as a goal creating legislation to give a tax break to companies like Airbnb.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, the fourth-floor hearing room of San Francisco&rsquo;s City Hall was packed to overflowing with 120 young people, many wearing buttons with the Airbnb logo.</p>\r\n<p>At the hearing, Jay Nath, Lee&rsquo;s chief technology officer, urged the city&rsquo;s tax administrator to postpone enforcing the tax until a newly appointed &ldquo;collaborative consumption work group&rdquo; could come up with a compromise.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The important thing is to have a policy discussion first, so we can see how to support companies built around the model of collaborative consumption,&rdquo; Lee said in an interview.</p>\r\n<p>Lee&rsquo;s stance seemed to represent an about-face from the position of San Francisco&rsquo;s previous mayor, Gavin Newsom. In March 2010, Newsom wrote to Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the United States House of Representatives, urging her to derail efforts by online travel agencies, a category that includes companies like Expedia and Travelocity, to obtain relief from local hotel taxes.</p>\r\n<p>Jennifer Matz, Lee&rsquo;s director of economic and workforce development, defended the apparent turnabout, saying that room rentals by individuals should be viewed in a different light than the hotel business.</p>\r\n<p>She said several mayoral staff members have been in discussions for the past month to help support a new type of business they call &ldquo;collaborative consumption,&rdquo; a category that includes vacation room rentals, car sharing, parking space sharing and other such activities. Fostering the growth of these kinds of emerging companies will help San Francisco develop a reputation as a cutting-edge tech hub, and that reputation might lure larger employers, Matz said.</p>\r\n<p>The meetings by Lee&rsquo;s staff members followed the publication of an article Conway wrote for The Economist, in which he said collaborative consumption was &ldquo;perhaps the most thought-provoking sector I see developing in 2012&rdquo; for venture capital investments. He cited as examples two of his portfolio companies, Airbnb and Rentcycle, which is also based in San Francisco.</p>\r\n<p>Airbnb is one of two local Conway-backed San Francisco companies that have run into recent regulatory difficulties. On Nov. 28, officials with the city&rsquo;s Municipal Transportation Agency recommended that the agency&rsquo;s board members consider possible problems with Square, the smartphone credit-card reader, before permitting taxi drivers to use it to collect payments from passengers. Unlike taxi-specific charging devices, the Square system is not connected to the meter, meaning that charges are not reported to regulators, according to a Municipal Transportation Agency staff report.</p>\r\n<p>The agency&rsquo;s board did not follow through on the staff recommendation, however. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in discussion with people in the Municipal Transportation Agency&rsquo;s taxi division to get off of initial positions that were held out of fear, and embrace what could be a technology that benefits everybody,&rdquo; Lee said.</p>", "slug": "cultivating-new-businesses-mayors-backer", "title": "In Cultivating New Businesses, Mayor\u2019s Treatment of Backer Is Questioned"}}, {"pk": 13668, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>More people are leaving the Bay Area than moving here from other locations in the United States, according to newly released data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\r\n<p>If it weren't for a steady influx of people moving to the region each year from other countries, the Bay Area's population would be in decline, the data show.</p>\r\n<p>Approximately 400,000 local residents move out of the Bay Area every year between 2005 and 2009, while just 345,000 people moved here from other parts of the country &mdash; a loss of about 55,000 residents annually.

Buckminster Fuller made a movie called &ldquo;Everything I Know.&rdquo; Over a two-week period, a crew filmed him sitting in a chair, speaking extemporaneously to the camera about anticipatory design, the geometry of the universe and his invention of the geodesic dome. By the time he had finished talking, the film was 42 hours.</p>\r\n<p>A pithy two-hour excerpt of &ldquo;Everything I Know&rdquo; greets visitors to &ldquo;The Utopian Impulse,&rdquo; a new exhibition about Fuller&rsquo;s visionary ideas and their influence on the Bay Area, opening Friday at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t find a player that could handle 42 hours of video,&rdquo; said Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher, the exhibition&rsquo;s curator. On the monitor behind her, the video played and Fuller said, &ldquo;My information stimulus from the brain is always terminal, so all my inputs are finite.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Fuller&rsquo;s loquaciousness, more even than the geodesic domes that made him famous, was his primary stock in trade. &ldquo;He spent a lot more time talking than doing,&rdquo; Fletcher said. Fuller died in 1983.</p>\r\n<p>Even the things he created were most compelling for the ways he described them. For instance, his three-wheel automobile &mdash; represented in the exhibition by a large photograph overlaid with patent drawings &mdash; was a commercial flop after a prototype crashed at the 1933 Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair.</p>\r\n<p>Yet his underlying notion of doing &ldquo;the most with the least&rdquo; &mdash; streamlining the car like an airplane for maximum efficiency &mdash; was decades ahead of Ford&rsquo;s steel-trap thinking, an example of anticipatory design (synthesizing art, science, engineering and economics) if ever there was one. By the 1960s, Fuller had found a mass audience, not within the auto industry but within the emerging counterculture, for which the idea of doing less with more was apposite. He gave lectures of epic length,  inspiring renegades half his age to act on his beliefs.</p>\r\n<p>%13129%</p>\r\n<p>The Whole Earth Catalog, first published in Menlo Park in 1968, was dedicated to him. &ldquo;Fuller&rsquo;s lectures have a raga quality of rich, nonlinear, endless improvisation,&rdquo; read an introductory tribute by Stewart Brand, the publisher. From Brand&rsquo;s LSD-enhanced perspective, Fuller preached self-sufficiency, which Brand sought to realize via his catalog &mdash; a mail-order sourcebook for everything from hunting boots to CB radios. &ldquo;I was persuaded by Fuller that tools and techniques were the essence of human progress,&rdquo; he wrote in an email, &ldquo;whereas politics often was a complete distraction.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Fletcher has included several vintage Whole Earth Catalogs in the exhibit, as well as one product that Fuller consulted on personally: the Oval Intention geodesic tent, first produced in Berkeley in the &rsquo;70s by the North Face. &ldquo;When you talk about the efficiency of being able to assemble a geodesic dome with one hand behind your back,&rdquo; said Fletcher, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the North Face tent.&rdquo; And unlike the trussed domes Fuller built, it didn&rsquo;t break or leak.</p>\r\n<p>After Fuller died, at 87, enthusiasm for his teachings cooled outside a small circle of  acolytes, who sought, through seminars and books, to turn the freest of free thinkers into the high priest of a cult. Only in the past decade have his ideas re-emerged.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Thom Mayne&rsquo;s 2007 San Francisco Federal Building, for example, incorporates a &ldquo;living skin&rdquo; of automatically adjusting windows  said to be influenced by Fuller. Represented by a 2007 study model in the exhibition, Mayne&rsquo;s building embodies the practical application of one of Fuller&rsquo;s most outlandish ideas: to enclose Midtown Manhattan under a dome that would moderate temperature swings to foster a &ldquo;Garden of Eden interior.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Yet the most fertile 21st-century application of Fuller&rsquo;s ideas has been in realms he could scarcely have imagined. &ldquo;Fuller had the notion that if you just had access to information, all the world&rsquo;s problems would be solved,&rdquo; Fletcher said. The Internet has finally made that possible, albeit not for everyone.</p>\r\n<p>The One Laptop per Child initiative, a nonprofit organization that gives cheap, durable tablets called XO Laptops to children, is arguably the most ambitious attempt to address the global imbalance in information access. So far, 2.6 million XOs have been distributed in countries from Uruguay to Rwanda. Yves B&eacute;har, the San Francisco-based designer responsible for the XO, did not create it in accordance with the geometry of the universe, but he considers himself indebted to Fuller. &ldquo;I think the notion of the utopian design project is alive in my generation of designers, and Buckminster Fuller has had a lot to do with it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The confidence to challenge the status quo has come from pioneers such as Bucky Fuller.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>If Fuller&rsquo;s ideas serve technology well, technology has returned the favor. His resurgent influence can partly be attributed to nostalgia for midcentury design and &rsquo;60s counterculture. But the Web has proved more decisive in his renewed popularity, allowing him to speak freely  again, unconstrained by disciples.</p>\r\n<p>Despite attempts by the Buckminster Fuller Institute to control video of Fuller&rsquo;s lectures, most of &ldquo;Everything I Know&rdquo; has been anonymously uploaded to YouTube.</p>\r\n<p><em>Jonathon Keats is most recently the author of &ldquo;Virtual Words&rdquo; (Oxford University Press).

Youth advocates, citing a lack of school buses and increasingly expensive passes, fought to make Muni free for all young people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I appreciate the sentiment that free Muni for all youth would help grow the next generation of transit riders, but we do have a budget reality we&rsquo;re operating in,&rdquo; Reiskin said.<br /> <br /> %related%</p>\r\n<p>Reiskin said that youth between ages 5 and 17 would qualify for free passes through an application much like the one schools use to determine eligibility for free or reduced-price lunches.

He has spent the past seven of them working mostly by himself, staring at a computer screen in a closed room. Earlier this month he began training his replacement, Officer Andrea Weyl, an energetic 33-year-old who is willing to trade the excitement of chasing criminals on the street for Esposto&rsquo;s lonely work.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case of the grizzled veteran and the bright-eyed newcomer,&rdquo; said Lt. Jason Fox, who supervises the pair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as old as police work itself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Esposto, 56, is tall and husky. Weyl has close-cropped red hair and a slight build. They share an office in the department&rsquo;s Special Victims Unit, their computers facing away from the door so that other officers do not have to see what they are looking at hour after hour, day after day: a seemingly endless procession of digital images of children being raped and abused.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to have somebody around,&rdquo; said Esposto, sitting at his work computer, which he confiscated from a child pornographer three years ago. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to have a partner.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Since 2004, Esposto has been the lone investigator in the department&rsquo;s Internet crimes against children unit. His skills include a working knowledge of computer forensics, an ability to discern the ages of child victims by looking at pictures and a lot of patience.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I may have to spend literally hours going through hundreds or thousands of images and bookmarking them,&rdquo; Esposto said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Andrea is going to have to understand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Weyl, who joined the department seven years ago, came from the violence reduction team in the Western Addition. She said she did not share much of what she was learning with her friends and family. &ldquo;I used to go home and say: &lsquo;I chased this guy through Sunnydale. It was awesome,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now I say: &lsquo;My day was all right. How was yours?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Both investigators said the nature of their daily viewing was gruesome, particularly videos, and especially those with sound. In some videos, Esposto said, children look into the camera, using their eyes to express their torment. He looks for details that might reveal the locations of the crimes.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I never get mad, never pass judgment, never have an opinion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just do the investigation.&rdquo; He rarely talks shop with other police officers. &ldquo;It makes people uncomfortable,&rdquo; Esposto said. &ldquo;Even here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Earlier this month Weyl began what eventually will be thousands of hours of training in computer forensics and child abuse investigations.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I asked for it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because there were too many cases for Inspector Esposto to handle, and I just wanted to make sure more cases got the attention they deserved.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>By most estimates, the global online child pornography market is worth billions of dollars a year, but no one knows how many billions, Esposto said. Nor can anyone say with certainty how big the problem is in San Francisco. At a recent training session, however, Esposto used a computer program that allowed him to find locations where child pornography was being viewed. &ldquo;In a time frame of an hour, we saw at least 25 locations in the San Francisco Bay Area with people that had suspicious files,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>Esposto handles about 50 Internet cases a year, splitting his time between online investigations and other child abuse cases in the city. Until recently he could&nbsp;only&nbsp;respond to tips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, outside law enforcement agencies or other beats within the SFPD because the department lacked resources for proactive child pornography investigations.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they brought me here, to learn from Ken, and they&rsquo;re hoping the two of us together can start doing more proactive investigations,&rdquo; Weyl said. &ldquo;If you figure that he&rsquo;s had that many cases part time, what&rsquo;s really going on out there when we start digging?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Digging means capturing images from computers and tracing them to physical locations and, ultimately, to perpetrators. In the best cases, the authorities are able to identify the victims in the images and locate them. Esposto said at least five of his cases last year resulted in rescued children.</p>\r\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom; width: 100%; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" title=\"Officer Andrea Weyl searches the kitchen of a man suspected of possessing child pornography on Friday, March 23, 2012, in San Francisco\" longdesc=\"Noah Berger for The Bay Citizen\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/san-francisco-police-departments-1/original/7020084685_fb4733c9f1_b.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco Police Department's Special Victims Unit 02\" /></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;At least 35 percent of people that engage in child pornography also engage in activities of child abuse, of abusing children sexually, so there&rsquo;s a direct connect with the two,&rdquo; Esposto said, citing research on police records. &ldquo;In the child pornography cases, these children are victimized over and over again, every time their photo is shown and shared.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Weyl&rsquo;s journey to the SVU began in October 2010. While she and her partner were walking a beat in the Western Addition, they noticed a camper van parked near a children&rsquo;s playground. They approached the vehicle after a man poked his head out the door, saw the police, and quickly ducked back inside.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I looked in and there were just images of kids everywhere,&rdquo; Weyl said. &ldquo;Kids&rsquo; toys, Mary-Kate and Ashley videos. Video cameras were mounted inside, pointing inward. He had a pretty sophisticated computer setup.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>She brought the case to Esposto and they worked it as a team. Weyl monitored the suspect for three months while she learned to write a warrant for suspected child pornography. The case went to federal court after the authorities discovered tens of thousands of files containing child pornography on the suspect&rsquo;s computers.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That case turned out to be the largest child pornography case in the history of the department,&rdquo; Fox said. &ldquo;I saw, then, Officer Weyl&rsquo;s work ethic and desire to put these people away.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Last Friday afternoon, Weyl and Esposto assembled a team of plainclothes police officers to help serve a search warrant on a Richmond District residence. Just after 6:30 p.m., the team entered the second-floor apartment without incident. Moments later, one occupant, Christian Schiefen, 34, was in handcuffs. His stunned wife sat in the couple&rsquo;s living room, guarded by two officers. No children lived in the house.</p>\r\n<p>After an initial search, Esposto and Weyl began interviewing Schiefen while two officers tried to calm his wife with casual conversation.</p>\r\n<p>Schiefen, dressed in sweatpants and a T-shirt, sat wide-eyed and fidgety, according to the investigators&rsquo; accounts.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to try to clear something up,&rdquo; Esposto said, before asking a series of questions that began with Schiefen&rsquo;s computer habits and led to his preference in pornography.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, man, everybody has their thing,&rdquo; Weyl said, wanting the suspect to relax and continue talking.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I might look for young women,&rdquo; Schiefen said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And if they&rsquo;re under 18, you still find them attractive and you look at them,&rdquo; Esposto said.</p>\r\n<p>After an hourlong interview, Weyl talked with Schiefen&rsquo;s wife, who tearfully asked, &ldquo;Is this really happening?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Schiefen was arrested on suspicion of possessing child pornography and taken to jail. The police left with two desktop computers, a laptop, two external hard drives and a cell phone as evidence.</p>\r\n<p>Later, thinking about Schiefen&rsquo;s wife, Weyl said, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather hear that your partner was a drug dealer than someone looking at child pornography?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Driving away from the scene, Esposto seemed satisfied with the night&rsquo;s work.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s a joyous experience, but I now know that that person is not going to victimize a kid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can wipe this clean now. This one&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>To switch gears after work, Esposto said, he likes to swim and read, mostly books on United States history. He has encouraged Weyl to indulge her hobbies too. &ldquo;I tell her: &lsquo;Have your personal life. Have a lot of interests. Don&rsquo;t let this consume you,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>Still, he added, &ldquo;You never get numb. I still have a tough time with it, but that&rsquo;s my crime scene.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That logic makes sense to Weyl.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When he first told me that, it helped me a lot,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll get better at it over time. But if Ken hasn&rsquo;t gotten used to it, I&rsquo;m not going to get used to it. In fact, I would be worried about myself if I ever got used to it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times. </em></p>", "slug": "training-catch-child-pornographers", "title": "Training to Catch Child Pornographers"}}, {"pk": 13672, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>On Tuesday, minutes after the end of a Berkeley Police Department promotion ceremony, reporters rushed over to interview Chief Michael Meehan.</p>\r\n<p>The journalists were not interested in details about the promotions. Instead, they pushed their microphones and cameras close to Meehan and pressed him for more information about his decision to send a sergeant to the house of an Oakland Tribune reporter in the middle of the night on March 9 to press for changes to an article about Meehan&rsquo;s department&rsquo;s response to a crime.</p>\r\n<p>The incident has raised a heated debate over free speech in this famously liberal city.</p>\r\n<p>Meehan tried hard to stay on message about reducing crime. But he could not escape scrutiny about what he admitted was a &ldquo;significant error of judgment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Christine Daniel, the interim city manager, hired a San Francisco law firm to examine the incident &mdash; but only after the police union pushed for an inquiry. City Council members, who by law are not allowed to interfere in personnel matters, appear to support Meehan unanimously because he has overseen a steady drop in crime and overtime expenses during his two-year tenure.</p>\r\n<p>Numerous residents, however, have called for Meehan&rsquo;s resignation, saying that he abused his power and violated the First Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>Meehan is not the first Berkeley official to get into trouble over an attempt to control the news media.&nbsp;In 2003, Mayor Tom Bates pleaded guilty to an infraction and paid a $100 fine for stealing 1,000 copies of The Daily Californian in 2002 because it endorsed his opponent.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Berkeley is a funny place,&rdquo; said Kriss Worthington, a City Council member. &ldquo;We have a strange relationship with free press and free speech.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The controversy over Meehan&rsquo;s actions has its roots in the way police responded to a Feb. 18 murder. Peter Cukor, 67, and his wife, Andrea, were returning to their home in the Berkeley hills around 8:30 p.m. when they encountered a stranger in their driveway who insisted he lived there. Cukor told the man to leave, then called the Berkeley police non-emergency number.</p>\r\n<p>The dispatcher ranked the call Priority 2, meaning there was no crime in progress or imminent danger to the caller. But the police department was responding only to Priority 1 calls at that time because it was preparing for the arrival of an Occupy Oakland march.</p>\r\n<p>Cukor walked across the street to a fire station, but no one was there. When he returned home, the young man, later identified as Daniel Jordan DeWitt, 23, allegedly beat him over the head with a ceramic planter.</p>\r\n<p>Around 8:59 p.m., Andrea Cukor called 911. Berkeley police responded immediately, but by the time paramedics arrived Cukor had gone into cardiac arrest, according to city documents. He was pronounced dead later that evening.</p>\r\n<p>Police arrested DeWitt within 25 minutes. He was charged with murder, but an Alameda County judge ruled last week that he was not mentally competent to stand trial.</p>\r\n<p>Outrage over the killing led Berkeley officials to call a community gathering on March 8. After the meeting, Doug Oakley, an Oakland Tribune reporter, wrote that Meehan had apologized for the way the police responded.</p>\r\n<p>But the chief had actually apologized for not communicating better with residents. When Meehan saw the article posted online around 11:30 p.m., he tried to email and call the reporter to get him to change it. When Meehan could not contact Oakley &mdash; he was asleep &mdash; the chief sent his public information officer, Sgt. Mary Kusmiss, to the reporter&rsquo;s house at 12:45 a.m.</p>\r\n<p>As news stories about the late-night visit to the reporter&rsquo;s house went viral, even landing in publications in Britain, Meehan issued an apology. At first, the interim city manager seemed to accept the explanation, releasing a statement on March 10 that the chief had assured her it would never happen again.</p>\r\n<p>The outrage grew, but Daniel did not make any further statements until March 16 after the police union called for an independent investigation. Thirty minutes after the union released its statement, Daniel said she had hired a law firm five days earlier to look into the matter.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the most intimidating of all types of prior restraint or censorship that can be exercised,&rdquo; said Jim Ewert, general counsel of the California Newspaper Publishers&rsquo; Association. &ldquo;It may have just been an exercise of bad judgment, but I think the citizens of Berkeley should scrutinize his future conduct pretty closely.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times. </em></p>", "slug": "berkeley-police-chief-center-free-speech", "title": "Berkeley Police Chief Is at Center of Free Speech Battle"}}, {"pk": 13673, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi plans to wage a new court battle to represent Binh Thai Luc, the man accused of killing five people in an Ingleside district home last week.</p>\r\n<p>Adachi said Thursday he would appeal a San Francisco Superior Court judge's ruling barring his office from representing Luc in the case.

Mirkarimi, the documents alleged, became angry, and threatened to use his political office to prevent his wife from leaving the country with their child.</p>\r\n<p>As part of Friday's order, Mirkarimi was required to sign a letter authorizing his wife's trip. The order reveals that Lopez's father \"has suffered a recurrence of cancer for which he is currently undergoing chemotherapy in Venezuela.\"</p>\r\n<p>According to the order, Mirkarimi plans to attend as many counseling sessions \"as possible\" while Lopez and Theo are in Venezuela. Mirkarimi is required to attend family counseling and 52 weeks of domestic violence prevention classes as part of his sentence. After Lopez returns, the couple intend to begin counseling together, the order says.</p>\r\n<p>Mirkarimi cannot move back into the family home while Lopez and Theo are out of the country. The judge crossed out a sentence in the order that would have given Mirkarimi permission to return to the house he shared with his wife until January, when another judge issued a stay-away order.</p>\r\n<p>That order, which barred Mirkarimi from having any contact with Lopez and Theo, was amended in February to allow Mirkarimi to see his son for two hours each weekday and six hours on one day each weekend.</p>\r\n<p>Since the stay-away order was issued, Mirkarimi has been paying rent to stay with friends, including former Mayor Art Agnos.</p>\r\n<p>While Lopez and Theo are in Venezuela, Mirkarimi can Skype with his son or talk with him on the phone, but he remains barred from having any contact with Lopez.

Colin Archipley left behind. He now grows basil and organic produce for local grocery stores and farmers&rsquo; markets instead of fighting insurgents, a respite from two tours of military service in Iraq.</p>\r\n<p>Coming home, the young Marine needed a second act. Archipley and his wife, Karen Archipley, founded their farm, Archi&rsquo;s Acres in 2006. They quickly developed a twofold mission: to operate a small-scale organic farm and to help soldiers make the leap from fighting abroad to emissaries for good food and entrepreneurialism.</p>\r\n<p>The couple belongs to a budding veterans-to-farms movement, intended to help farmers and former soldiers. Recruiting vets and returning soldiers released from military service may help to reinvigorate aging farming populations. Many are expected to retire within the next decade.</p>\r\n<p>The average age of U.S. farmers was 57 in 2007, and the number of farmers over 75 had increased 20% since the 2002 Census.</p>\r\n<p>Archipley&rsquo;s entry into agriculture was circuitous. Growing up in Northern California he had never envisioned a career in farming until he became one himself. After three tours of duty, Archipley was at a crossroads. His initial plan was to sell real estate. But the thought of an office job and the vagaries of driving clients around town seemed implausible at best, he said.</p>\r\n<p>The housing market had collapsed. At the time, Karen Archipley campaigned for relocating to Tuscany in Italy. Colin Archipley wanted to remain stateside. They agreed on a small avocado farm located on the backside of Camp Pendleton, in a vibrant landscape fecund with possibilities. San Diego County is the 12th largest farm economy in the United States with annual revenues in the billions of dollars.</p>\r\n<p>Farming suited Archipley and he saw the potential to help other veterans. &ldquo;Soldiers need a mission and farming provides that,&rdquo; he said. Soon, the Veterans Sustainable Agriculture Training program (VSAT) began.</p>\r\n<p>Inside a large barn-like building turned classroom are a mix of enlisted, reservists and retired military. Students are expected to master the fundamentals of irrigation, hydroponics and marketing, with the long-term goal of being self-employed. At the end of six weeks, they&rsquo;re expected to present a business plan to local agriculture entrepreneurs and potential investors.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rigorous six week program,&rdquo; said Archipley.</p>\r\n<p>Initially they offered informal internships. The program is now administered by Mira Costa Community College and has grown via word of mouth, with assistance from a network of friends and colleagues both inside and outside military channels.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The advice I give to them is to know your product and to know your market,&rdquo; said Dwight Detter, a Vietnam veteran and produce specialist for Whole Foods supermarkets whose focus it is to identify new vendors.</p>\r\n<p>In the waning days of the winter session, students are busy finishing their business presentations, marking the final hurdle before graduation and the possibility of new careers.</p>\r\n<p>Each student has different agendas, but with one clear goal in mind &mdash; to be self-employed and financially secure. Victor Love, 45, hopes to make the transition to food entrepreneur. Reagan Clark, 34, lately of the Occupy Dallas movement, wants to create an earth-friendly laundry detergent. Lance Corporal Justin Roberts, 22, one week shy of leaving the Marines, intends to return to South Carolina with plans to grow organic tomatoes on family property.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the veterans arriving at Archi&rsquo;s Acres bear the invisible wounds of war, Karen Archipley said, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and brain-blast injuries. The pernicious effects of combat duty can make the transition from soldier to civilian life more difficult.</p>\r\n<p>According to the research foundation the RAND Corporation, 1 in 5 soldiers of the 1.6 million troops deployed to Iran and Afghanistan from 2001 to 2007 may suffer from PTSD, approximately 300,000 cases.</p>\r\n<p>Farming allows soldiers to decompress, but more broadly gives military personnel a sense of purpose, Colin Archipley said. For him, the benefits of growing food are tangible. &ldquo;At the end of the day you can say honestly you&rsquo;ve accomplished something and contributed to your community.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to quantify the psychological benefits of farming, but the stories of VSAT alumni are a testament to the program&rsquo;s impact. In 2004, &ldquo;Forager&rdquo; Mike Hanes enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 18.</p>\r\n<p>In Baghdad, he manned a .50-caliber machine gun mounted atop a HumVee vehicle. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re trained to kill, pull the trigger and then are in combat, it&rsquo;s kind of difficult to turn that off,&rdquo; he said. He returned to the United States unable to hold a steady job.</p>\r\n<p>Adrift, he eventually lived outdoors. Sleeping in the dense undergrowth of San Diego&rsquo;s trails, a place where he felt comfortable, he said. He still completed a degree in environmental studies during this period, he said.</p>\r\n<p>In 2010, he ran into the Archipleys while attending Earth Day in Balboa Park in San Diego. He was immediately hooked. Although he struggled through the program, he graduated in 2011. Now, with help from VSAT, he&rsquo;s the founder and proprietor of Hot Dang !!!, a raw foods hot sauce sold at Whole Foods supermarkets in Southern California and through his website.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I can show to my daughter and be proud of,&rdquo; he said.</p>", "slug": "program-helps-veterans-become-farmers", "title": "Program Helps Soldiers Become Farmers"}}, {"pk": 13682, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>Prosecutors today filed murder charges against a man accused of killing five people in a home in San Francisco's Ingleside neighborhood on Friday.</p>\r\n<p>Binh Thai Luc, 35, was arrested Sunday morning in connection with the grisly killing of three women and two men inside a home at 16 Howth St.&nbsp;near City College of San Francisco.</p>\r\n<p>Luc, a San Francisco resident, was charged today with five counts of murder with special circumstances for committing multiple murders,&nbsp;district attorney's office spokesman Omid Talai said.</p>\r\n<p>He is expected to be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, Talai said.</p>\r\n<p>The case was reported at 7:45 a.m. Friday by a family member who entered the home and called 911 after encountering three of the bodies.</p>\r\n<p>Police responded and found two others dead in the home.</p>\r\n<p>The medical examiner's office on Monday released the identities of the victims but has not released their cause of death, although police Chief&nbsp;Greg Suhr said some type of \"edged weapon\" was used.</p>\r\n<p>The women were identified as Wan Yi Xu, 62; Chia Huei Chu, 30; and Ying Xue Lei, 37, and the men were identified as Hua Shun Lei, 65, and Vincent Lei, 32.</p>\r\n<p>Police have said four of the five victims were family members but have yet to say what the relationship was.

We know that he did not want to step down. I expected him to do everything possible to not have to,\" he told reporters Tuesday afternoon.</p>\r\n<p>After Mirkarimi was sentenced last week to three years' probation for falsely imprisoning his wife, Eliana Lopez, during an argument on Dec. 31, Lee gave him an ultimatum: resign or face official misconduct proceedings.&nbsp;When Mirkarimi refused to step down, Lee suspended him and filed charges against him.</p>\r\n<p>In Tuesday's court filing, David Waggoner, Mirkarimi's attorney, argued that the suspension was illegal, because Mirkarimi was not sheriff on Dec. 31 and that the incident for which he pleaded guilty did not occur at work and does not interfere with his duties as sheriff.</p>\r\n<p>At the time of the Dec. 31 incident, Mirkarimi was a member of the Board of Supervisors. He was sworn in as sheriff on Jan. 8 and was arrested on Jan. 12 for three misdemeanor charges, including domestic violence battery. Prosecutors dropped those charges earlier this month, after Mirkarimi agreed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor false imprisonment charge.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>In the filing, Waggoner cited previous court rulings &mdash; including in a 1980 case involving San Francisco and former airport commissioner Joseph Mazzola &mdash; that official misconduct must be related to the office and must occur while the accused is in office.</p>\r\n<p>Waggoner also argued that the city denied Mirkarimi his due process by suspending him for a misdemeanor and that definition of the \"official misconduct\" in the San Francisco City Charter is unconstitutional.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The law is crystal clear that an elected official cannot be removed for conduct that occurred before they took office and is not directly related to their job responsibilities,&rdquo; Waggoner said in a statement. &ldquo;Mayor Lee&rsquo;s suspension of Ross Mirkarimi violates the law in several respects and we are asking the court to intervene and reinstate him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Waggoner's argument directly contradicts the claims made by the mayor and the City Attorney's Office in the official misconduct charges against Mirkarimi, filed last Wednesday. According to those charges, the misconduct did not have to occur while Mirkarimi was sheriff, nor did it have to be \"related to the specific duties\" of his office.</p>\r\n<p>But Lee noted that many of the allegations against Mirkarimi do overlap directly with his duties as sheriff.</p>\r\n<p>\"The Sheriff is the City official charged by law with receiving prisoners and overseeing the jails,\" the charges state. \"Sheriff Mirkarimi's one-day sentence to county jail undermines his ability to receive inmates and to supervise the County jails.\"</p>\r\n<p>The charges also cite the sheriff's close relationship with the city's Adult Probation Department (\"Sheriff Mirkarimi committed criminal acts that could and did result in Sheriff Mirkarimi serving three years of probation\"), his role in responding to domestic violence cases (\"Sheriff Mirkarimi engaged in acts of domestic violence\"), and his responsibility for \"ensuring the legal and judicious imprisonment of inmates.\"</p>\r\n<p>Waggoner said he will ask the court to set a date to hear&nbsp;arguments on the case in the next week.</p>\r\n<p>Barring a decision from the court, the five-member Ethics Commission will hold hearings on the Mirkarimi case in the next few weeks, according to Lee. If the commission votes to recommend sustaining the charges against Mirkarimi, the Board of Supervisors will hold hearings on whether to oust him.</p>\r\n<p>Nine of the board's 11 members must approve his removal.</p>\r\n<p>For now, Vicki Hennessy is the interim sheriff.

No one from The Bay Citizen&rsquo;s current senior editorial or technology management teams will have a leadership role in the expanded organization.</p>\r\n<p>The Bay Citizen will likely no longer cover breaking news or culture, as CIR leaders have said they see those as commodities that don&rsquo;t fit the expanded organization&rsquo;s core mission. CIR is also considering whether to continue providing coverage for The New York Times. The Bay Citizen&rsquo;s reporting currently appears twice weekly in the Bay Area section of The Times.</p>\r\n<p>Proponents of the deal, in the works since December, say each of the two nonprofit organizations will bring its strengths to the other: CIR brings The Bay Citizen the prestige and heft of a well-established outlet that breaks state, national and international stories, while The Bay Citizen brings a fast-paced newsroom built for the Internet era, a donor and membership base of more than 8,000 and healthy cash reserves.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The goal here is to have an organization that would have a strong local focus in the Bay Area as well as have an opportunity and the ability to do stories that are relevant to California, as well as national and international stories,&rdquo; said Robert Rosenthal, CIR&rsquo;s executive director. CIR will operate three brands &mdash; The Bay Citizen, covering the local region; California Watch, a project founded in 2009 to report on statewide issues; and CIR, which for more than 30 years has reported on hundreds of major stories, and which earlier this year won a MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions, bringing $1 million.</p>\r\n<p>Those brands will all work in one newsroom &mdash; at a location still to be determined &mdash; bringing local stories to a national and international audience and relevant national and global stories to the Bay Area.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm excited to see what the new organization can do,&rdquo; said Brian Kelley, The Bay Citizen&rsquo;s interim CEO.   \"The merger brings together the strengths of both of our organizations, expanding our capabilities in journalism and technology.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Bay Citizen reporter Aaron Glantz, chairman of the organization&rsquo;s Media Workers Guild unit, expressed relief that the process was nearly complete and the uncertainty over. &ldquo;We are very excited,&rdquo; he said in a text message, after speaking to colleagues. &ldquo;This is good for journalism. We look forward to working with our new colleagues and being part of one of the most aggressive newsrooms on the West Coast.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Jeff Ubben, current chairman of The Bay Citizen&rsquo;s board of directors, and the family of the late financier Warren Hellman, founder of The Bay Citizen, together committed more than $4 million in additional funding to the merged entity, Rosenthal said.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; width: 50%; margin-right: 15px;\" title=\"Jeff Ubben, chairman of The Bay Citizen&rsquo;s board of directors, addresses Bay Citizen staff after a merger between The Bay Citizen and the Center for Investigative Reporting was approved on March 27, 2012\" longdesc=\"Adithya Sambamurthy/The Bay Citizen\" src=\"https://citizen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploaded/images/2012/3/jeff-ubben/original/jeff%20ubben.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Ubben\" />&ldquo;Our dad felt strongly that democracy only works if there is a vibrant press, and that local journalism in particular needed strong community support in order to survive and fulfill its essential mission,&rdquo; Hellman&rsquo;s son Marco (\"Mick\") Hellman said in a press release. &ldquo;Our family agrees with that point of view. We feel that the merger with CIR offers the opportunity to renew leadership, add strength to the reporting staff, and diversify revenue models and content distribution channels.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Warren Hellman founded The Bay Citizen (initially known by the name of its parent organization, the Bay Area News Project) after watching in despair as the Hearst Corporation threatened to shut down the financially hemorrhaging San Francisco Chronicle in 2009. Hellman, a noted investment banker and philanthropist, considered buying the paper before he decided to start a new, online news organization instead. Hellman initially gave $5 million to start The Bay Citizen, then added another $1 million. The funds were the cornerstones of an ambitious fundraising effort that ultimately brought in $17.5 million.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Warren cared a lot about San Francisco, and he genuinely believed strong journalism was important to a strong community,&rdquo; said Jonathan Weber, the site&rsquo;s first editor-in-chief, who is now the West Coast bureau chief for Reuters. &ldquo;He saw the dramatic weakening of journalism in the Bay Area, and he decided to do something about it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Bay Citizen launched in May 2010. It has won the Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists and the James Madison Freedom of Information Award.</p>\r\n<p>The recent series of changes at the organization began last fall, when Weber and Lisa Frazier, the chief executive of The Bay Citizen, announced their departures. In December, Warren Hellman died of complications from leukemia at age 77. In February, Interim Editor-in-Chief Steve Fainaru also left, completing the creation of what Kelley, the interim CEO, called &ldquo;a leadership vacuum.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Bay Citizen board approached CIR&rsquo;s chairman, former San Francisco Chronicle Editor Phil Bronstein, about the vacant CEO position. Bronstein wasn&rsquo;t interested in the job, he said, but instead suggested the merger. In early February, <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/media/story/bay-citizen-center-investigative-intent/\" target=\"_blank\">the two organizations announced they were exploring the possible union</a>&nbsp;and that their respective boards would vote within 30 days. Extra time was needed to ensure that funders would continue to support the merged entity.</p>\r\n<p>Within the past two weeks, Tom Goldstein, the interim dean of the University of California&rsquo;s Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, resigned from The Bay Citizen&rsquo;s board. Goldstein said he was the last member of the board who wanted to see The Bay Citizen remain independent. (Another board member, Andrew Woeber, a managing director of the investment bank Greenhill &amp; Co., also left in recent weeks.)</p>\r\n<p>The merger became official on Tuesday when the boards of directors of both organizations voted to approve it. Under the law, California Attorney General Kamala Harris oversees mergers of nonprofit corporations. Harris now has 20 days to review the merger. Unless Harris determines that the missions of the two nonprofit news organizations are incompatible, the merger would take effect at the end of the 20-day review period.</p>\r\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; float: right; width: 50%; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 15px;\" title=\"Members of The Bay Citizen's staff listen to Phil Bronstein talk about the merger between The Bay Citizen and the Center for Investigative Reporting on March 27, 2012\" longdesc=\"Adithya Sambamurthy/The Bay Citizen\" src=\"https://citizen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploaded/images/2012/3/bay-citizen-staff/original/staff%20listens_adi_web.jpg\" alt=\"Bay Citizen Staff\" />Under the terms of the agreement, the BANP will be dissolved and the two boards will merge to form a 19-member board of directors, although several of those positions are currently vacant. Six people remain on The Bay Citizen&rsquo;s board, while eight are on CIR&rsquo;s board, with two CIR board members &mdash; David Weir and Dan Noyes &mdash; assuming new, nonvoting roles as &ldquo;co-founder emeritus,&rdquo; Bronstein said.</p>\r\n<p>Bronstein will become executive chairman, overseeing operations. He said he will work closely with Rosenthal, who will remain executive director. Rosenthal worked for Bronstein as managing editor at The Chronicle. While Rosenthal will report to Bronstein, he said his role will be editorially focused, while Bronstein will work with funders. The two will earn the same salary; in 2010, according to CIR&rsquo;s filing with the Internal Revenue Service, Rosenthal earned $203,750.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, CIR&rsquo;s Associate Director Christa Scharfenberg, Editorial Director Mark Katches, Director of Digital Media Sharon Tiller and Director of Technology Chase Davis will continue to hold those roles in the new organization.&nbsp;Kelley,&nbsp;The Bay Citizen&rsquo;s interim CEO, who had previously been chief technology officer, will leave.</p>\r\n<p>The merger marks a step forward in Rosenthal&rsquo;s effort to turn around the once-struggling Center for Investigative Reporting. Founded in 1977, it had garnered notice and awards for stories that aired on PBS&rsquo; &ldquo;Frontline&rdquo; and CBS&rsquo; &ldquo;60 Minutes,&rdquo; but its finances remained precarious. &ldquo;When I became executive director&rdquo; in January 2008, Rosenthal wrote last year, &ldquo;the organization was at risk.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was basically starting from scratch with a staff of seven people and a budget around $1.5 million,&rdquo; Rosenthal wrote. &ldquo;Much of that funding was dedicated to a documentary film project. There were no major funds in any pipeline.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>CIR now has a staff of 40 and a budget of about $6 million, he said. The new organization will have a budget of $10.5 million in 2012 and a staff of approximately 70. Rosenthal and Bronstein said they did not anticipate any layoffs, at least initially.</p>\r\n<p>As with any startup, change is almost constant, and survival is always precarious. A venture similar to The Bay Citizen, the Chicago News Cooperative, also a publishing partner of The New York Times, suspended operations earlier this year.</p>\r\n<p>The Bay Citizen was launched with big plans. &ldquo;The Bay Citizen had a very ambitious and expansive mission to try to beef up the creation and production of high-quality journalism about issues important to the Bay Area,&rdquo; said Weber, the founding editor.</p>\r\n<p>The organization faced difficult questions, particularly as it defined its mission. Should it cover breaking news? What about the arts and culture? Weber answered both affirmatively. &ldquo;It was my firm view, if you&rsquo;re going to be a news site, you have to cover the news,&rdquo; Weber said. &ldquo;If you said, &lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not going to cover these breaking stories because the Chronicle is going to cover them,&rsquo; you can&rsquo;t create a site with regular readership.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, he said, &ldquo;The culture side of things is very central to people&rsquo;s lives in the Bay Area. If you say you&rsquo;ll only cover public policy, by definition you are only covering a small segment of things that people care about and are important to community.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>With fewer than a dozen reporters at its peak, the site was stretched thin trying to meet this broad mission, in addition to its partnership with The New York Times, Weber said.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Now, CIR will decide which, if any, of those three areas &mdash; breaking news, culture and the partnership with The Times &mdash; will survive.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s definitely going to be changes in the editorial strategy,&rdquo; Rosenthal said. &ldquo;The core is going to be much more focused on accountability investigative reporting. Breaking news is not going to be our forte. The value we have &mdash; why news organizations around the world want to work with us &mdash; is giving people stories that they can&rsquo;t get elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Bronstein said to expect more emphasis on journalism that helps people find solutions to problems, something that he often touted during his tenure at the Chronicle. Foundations that give grants to CIR expect it, he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the healthiest things that&rsquo;s happened to our profession in years, the support for high-impact, solutions-based journalism,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People get nervous that it&rsquo;s crossing the line or coming close to advocacy. It&rsquo;s helping people get to a solution.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As for The New York Times, Rosenthal said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to be something we&rsquo;ll assess during the transition period. We really want to look at the pluses and negatives around it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Jim Schachter, associate managing editor of The New York Times, said he hoped The Bay Citizen would continue to bolster The Times&rsquo; Bay Area coverage. &ldquo;We have been extremely proud of the reporting that our colleagues at The Bay Citizen have done for the last two years,&rdquo; Schachter said. &ldquo;We think that the Bay Area can only benefit from muscular, enterprising journalism.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"We&rsquo;re huge admirers of the Center for Investigative Reporting,\" Schachter said. \"Should the merger be completed, we&rsquo;re looking forward to having a conversation with the new management that emerges about working together.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The changes, said current and former Bay Citizen staff members, will be bittersweet. The Bay Citizen &ldquo;has one of the highest concentrations of journalistic talent and journalistic quality in the Bay Area,&rdquo; said Gerry Shih, who was a reporter for The Bay Citizen from its launch until December, when he left to join Reuters as a technology reporter. &ldquo;Pound for pound, the staff there was phenomenal. It was a massive privilege to be working along with those people. And coming up on two years, we produced a lot of great work.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Jeanne Carstensen, executive managing editor of The Bay Citizen, said,&nbsp;&ldquo;With its tremendous diversity, the Bay Area has always presented a challenge for local news organizations. It&rsquo;s the nature of the beast. Our small, feisty newsroom reported on a lot of important local news and culture stories that wouldn&rsquo;t have been covered otherwise.  I&rsquo;m very proud of our insightful, hard-hitting coverage of the pension debate, the rise of Mayor Ed Lee, ranked choice voting, San Francisco&rsquo;s Civic Art Collection, Oscar Grant and so many other topics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The good news, Shih said, is that &ldquo;CIR is an organization with significant stature and quality in journalism.\"</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Shih said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s undeniable that The Bay Citizen is not going to be The Bay Citizen that was originally founded.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>Dan Fost is a freelance writer, the former media columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, and the author of the baseball book, \"Giants Past and Present.\" You can reach him at <a href=\"mailto:danfost@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">danfost@gmail.com</a>.</em></p>", "slug": "bay-citizen-center-investigative-merge", "title": "Bay Citizen, Center for Investigative Reporting to Merge"}}, {"pk": 13687, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; width: 50%;\" title=\"Pediatric audiologist Anne Simon runs a remote exam from an office at the UC Davis Medical Center.\" longdesc=\"Heather Gilligan/California Health Report, via HealthyCal\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/medical-tv/original/ped_tele.jpeg\" alt=\"Medical TV\" />Grace Lee, five weeks old, swaddled in a pink-stripped blanket, dozes in her mother&rsquo;s arms in a room at a hospital in Redding. The baby failed two hearing tests in her first two days of life, and a follow-up exam a week later suggested trouble in one ear.</p>\r\n<p>Evaluating her hearing loss within the first three months of her life was essential. If follow-up tests indicated a permanent problem, she&rsquo;d need to be fitted with a hearing aid to have the best chance of developing unimpaired speech and other important skills later in life.</p>\r\n<p>Grace needed a pediatric audiologist to do the tests. But her family lives in the wide swath of California north of Sacramento, where pediatric audiologists &ndash; and pediatric specialists generally &ndash; are hard to find.</p>\r\n<p>So instead of being examined in her room at Mercy Hospital in Redding, Grace was beamed into an office at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento via videoconferencing.</p>\r\n<p>UC Davis has a well-established telemedicine program, where specialists consult with doctors in remote or underserved locations. The numbers suggest that the need for specialists to test kids&rsquo; hearing is acute in the far north of California. Depending on the year, anywhere between 20 and 40 percent of children in that region who don&rsquo;s pass the newborn screen don&rsquo;t return for follow-up tests and treatment, according to Anne Simon, pediatric audiologist at UC Davis Medical Center.</p>\r\n<p>The pediatric audiology telemedicine program has seen all seven of its patients this year remotely, but the visit went far beyond the typical consult. Simon wasn&rsquo;t giving advice &ndash; she was performing tests herself.</p>\r\n<p>Technicians Dawn Deines and Debbie Nickell acted as Simon&rsquo;s hands in Redding, attaching electrodes to Grace&rsquo;s head and inserting a probe into her ear as she slept on her mother&rsquo;s lap. Data from the probes and wires streamed to Simon&rsquo;s laptop screen.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt,&rdquo; Simon assured Jessica, Grace&rsquo;s mother, as Deines and Nickell gently scrubbed the baby&rsquo;s scalp before attaching electrodes to her head.</p>\r\n<p>The setup has its challenges. Simple tests are harder over a video monitor. A basic examination of the outside of Grace&rsquo;s ear took several readjustments of the digital camera, and Simon still wasn&rsquo;t able to get as good a look as she&rsquo;d like. Looking inside a baby&rsquo;s ear with an otoscopy is harder over a video feed too, she said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Audiologists by nature are very controlling,&rdquo; Simon said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little tiny baby and I want it to be done right.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Comforting the parents is another part of the job that&rsquo;s harder to do over video, Simon said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important that mom knows she has a wonderful baby no matter how the test goes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Though the distance makes the exam more challenging for the audiologist, the telecommute makes life much easier for parents who live in the far north of California. A drive of seven hours round trip with an infant to see an audiologist, which for many families would also mean an overnight stay and a day or two off of work, made the follow-up appointment too difficult, Simon said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just difficult for them to have to drive three or four hours to see an audiologist,&rdquo; said James Marcin, professor of pediatric critical care medicine and director of the UC Davis Health System Pediatric Telemedicine Program.

As communities rebuild and mourn the loss of loved ones, a portion of the 25 million tons of wreckage is now swirling around the ocean and making its way to California shores.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a unique research opportunity for scientists who have never before seen such a sudden, massive deposit of ocean debris from a one-time event.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Over the years we&rsquo;ve been tracking where debris collects. A clearer picture will eventually appear,&rdquo; said Mary Jane Schramm, Outreach Specialist at the Gulf of the Farallones, a division of NOAA.<br /><br />Researchers are tracking the debris as it&rsquo;s carried by currents in hopes they will improve their models on the way ocean debris moves and where it ultimately settles. Every year an average of 14 million tons of garbage make it into the world&rsquo;s oceans, swept along by gyres and finding its way to coastlines where marine animals consume it or become entangled -- often with deadly effect.</p>\r\n<p>Several models predict that if the tsunami debris collects anywhere, in about three years&rsquo; time that place will likely be near the center of the Pacific Ocean at what&rsquo;s been termed the&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/oceanography/great-pacific-garbage-patch.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a></span>. University of Hawaii, Manoa researchers are concentrating their search for tsunami debris on the western coastline of the island of Midway, an atoll in the middle of the Pacific garbage patch.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The problem is going to be knowing which pieces come from Japan and which didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said John Largier, a University of California, Davis oceanographer.<br /><br />Scientists are using small electronic transmitters, called trackers, to follow the tsunami debris. They have also enlisted the help of the shipping industry to report patches. Early reports show that much of it is breaking up and sinking to the ocean floor. Some of it is also expected to reach the West Coast of the Americas this fall or winter, a full 18 months after the disaster struck Japan. An unmanned Japanese fishing trawler&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/9165963/Japanese-trawler-lost-in-tsunami-spotted-from-Canada.html\" target=\"_blank\">was recently discovered</a></span>&nbsp;off the coast of British Columbia, a ghostly reminder of the tragedy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some news stations have reported that&nbsp;<span class=\"link-external\"><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/video?id=8540001&amp;rss=rss-kgo-video-8540001\" target=\"_blank\">\"huge amounts of debris are bound for the California coastline.\"&nbsp;</a></span>But scientists say don&rsquo;t expect a deluge of trash.

In fact, people who were without coverage and obtain it use the ER more than people who have steady coverage or no coverage at all. People who lose their coverage also use ERs more, the study finds, so it seems to be a change in health insurance status, more than anything, that leads to an increased use of the emergency room.</p>\r\n<p>The study, published today in the&nbsp;<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://archinte.ama-assn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Archives of Internal Medicine</a>, was authored by researchers at the University of Colorado and the Oregon Health and Science University.</p>\r\n<p>The study analyzed 159,934 adults who took part in the National Health Interview Survey between 2004 and 2009. The survey respondents were divided into categories of newly insured, continuously insured, , newly uninsured or continuously uninsured. The newly insured or uninsured were placed in those categories if their status had changed during the previous 12 months.</p>\r\n<p>The researchers found that overall, about the same proportion &mdash; around 20 percent &mdash; of insured and uninsured people had visited an emergency room in the prior year. But almost 30 percent of newly insured adults had done so, compared to 20.2 percent of continuously insured people. And about 26 percent of newly uninsured people had been to the ER, compared to about 19 percent of continuously uninsured people.</p>\r\n<p>Among newly insured adults, the connection between their insurance status and their visits to an ER was strongest for people who were newly on Medicaid, the government-subsidized health insurance program for the poor.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As policy changes and economic forces create disruptions in health insurance status,&rdquo; the authors conclude, &ldquo;new surges in (emergency department) use should be anticipated.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The results could mean new, unanticipated hurdles for the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act if it survives legal and political challenges.</p>\r\n<p>While it has been anticipated that the expansion of insurance coverage might lead to more visits to an already over-burdened primary care system, many policymakers seem to have counted on a reduction in emergency room visits. This would mean a savings not only for hospitals and the government but for the private insurance market as well, since hospitals are known to shift the uncompensated cost of caring for the uninsured to their insured customers through higher fees.

The charge arose from <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/ross-mirkarimi-3/story/mirkarimi-cant-move-back-home/\">an argument  Mirkarimi had with his wife, Eliana Lopez</a>, on Dec. 31, in which he grabbed her by the arm.

Something failed him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Guilfoyle&rsquo;s death is one of a series of recent suicides by veterans who live in the jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. The Palo Alto V.A. is one of the agency&rsquo;s elite campuses, home to the Congressionally chartered National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The poor record of the Department of Veterans Affairs in decreasing the high suicide rate of veterans has already emerged as a major issue for policy makers and the judiciary.</p>\r\n<p>On Wednesday, the V.A. Inspector General in Washington released the results of a nine-month investigation into the May 2010 death of another veteran, William Hamilton. The report said social workers at the department in Palo Alto made &ldquo;no attempt&rdquo; to ensure that Hamilton, a mentally ill 26-year-old who served in Iraq, was hospitalized at a department facility in the days before he killed himself by stepping in front of a train in Modesto.</p>\r\n<p>The Bay Area was also shocked by the March 14 death of Abel Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Iraq war veteran, who the police said killed his mother and his 11-year-old sister before shooting himself.

Chad Gallacinao, a spokesman for the police department. Sergeant Gallacinao said a police officer who was also a military veteran was dispatched to the house and took notes.</p>\r\n<p>Two days later, Sergeant Gallacinao said, the officer returned to the Gutierrez home with a representative of the Community Veterans Project, a nonprofit organization that trains law enforcement officials in interaction with psychologically wounded veterans.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They made contact with the V.A. specifically to obtain services for  Gutierrez,&rdquo; Sergeant Gallacinao said.</p>\r\n<p>Dave Bayard, a V.A. spokesman in Los Angeles, confirmed that a call had been placed to the Vet Center  in Santa Cruz, but said the request was mild. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t like &lsquo;This guy is really in need of mental health,&rsquo;\uf02e&rdquo;  Bayard said.</p>\r\n<p>The V.A. said  Gutierrez had briefly received care at a department facility in Washington State, where he was a National Guardsman, but never visited a department campus in California.</p>\r\n<p>In an e-mail, Kerri Childress, spokeswoman for the V.A. Palo Alto Health Care System,  said that despite the intervention of the Gilroy Police Department in  Gutierrez&rsquo;s case, &ldquo;We had no way of knowing he was even in the area.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Shad Meshad, a Vietnam War veteran and former combat medic who heads the National Veterans Foundation, was unpersuaded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time that they don&rsquo;t make excuses,&rdquo;  Meshad said. &ldquo;Why would you say it&rsquo;s not serious when the police called?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Meshad said the responses of  Bayard and  Childress were typical of the &ldquo;finger-pointing&rdquo; exhibited by the department when tragedy strikes.</p>\r\n<p>Before  Hamilton killed himself, he said he saw demon women and regularly talked to a man he had killed in Iraq. He had been admitted to the Palo Alto V.A.&rsquo;s psychiatric ward before on nine separate occasions. Three days before he died,  Hamilton&rsquo;s father brought him to a community hospital in Calaveras County, which, according to hospital records obtained by The Bay Citizen, tried to transfer him to three V.A. hospitals, including the one in Palo Alto. But at 4:39 p.m., a department social worker wrote that day in his notes, the Palo Alto facilities &ldquo;would not accept a transfer of a veteran for admittance this late in the day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Later that night,  Hamilton was admitted to David Grant Medical Center at Travis Air Force base in Fairfield. That Sunday, the medical center discharged  Hamilton. Within hours, he was dead.</p>\r\n<p>V.A. officials have said they have no record of  Hamilton being denied care and that their records do not show any telephone calls between the Calaveras County hospital and the Palo Alto V.A. But the inspector general&rsquo;s report revealed that the Palo Alto hospital had no method of tracking incoming calls and that &ldquo;no outgoing calls were recorded&rdquo; from any Veterans Affairs Medical Center extension.</p>\r\n<p>During the investigation into  Hamilton&rsquo;s death, the inspector general learned of yet another incident, in May 2011, when the doctor on duty refused to accept a veteran for treatment. According to the report, the psychiatrist said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t accept patients for transfer at night.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In an e-mailed response to questions, Dr. Stephen Ezeji-Okoye, deputy chief of staff of the Palo Alto V.A., said that since  Hamilton&rsquo;s death his network had &ldquo;revised our tracking mechanism so we are better able to analyze the disposition of any cases referred to the V.A. Palo Alto Health Care System.&rdquo; Dr. Ezeji-Okoye said the Palo Alto V.A. had always accepted psychiatric patients 24 hours a day, every day of the year.</p>\r\n<p>Childress, the agency spokeswoman, said the Palo Alto V.A. was committed to improving the quality and availability of mental health care. The hospital is building a new 80-bed inpatient mental health center, she said, which is scheduled to open in June. It will have &ldquo;patient access to enclosed, landscaped gardens&rdquo; and &ldquo;ample use of natural light to all internal patients,&rdquo; she said, with a color scheme &ldquo;specifically selected to support the healing process.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times. </em></p>", "slug": "suicides-highlight-failures-veterans", "title": "Suicides Highlight Failures in Veterans\u2019 Support System "}}, {"pk": 13697, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><em>For decades, Samiramis Imports at 2990 Mission St. in San Francisco has been a go-to for Middle Eastern breads, music, films and its revered Turkish coffee.

In 2006, the city began pouring millions of dollars into scouting for and hiring over 100 new officers, only to lay off 80 of them after failed union negotiations in 2010.</p>\r\n<p>The department reached a high of 837 officers in November 2008, but the number has fallen to 636, according to city records. With a rapidly shrinking police force and soaring violent crime rates, the City Council decided to finance the first police academy class in four years. But the new recruits will barely stanch the bleeding.</p>\r\n<p>From the hundreds of applicants, the department will offer training to only 55 new hires. Not all of the recruits will finish the six-month academy training, though, and by June 2013, officials estimate they will have just 617 officers on the Oakland force.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We lose so many people through attrition,&rdquo; said Juan Sanchez, an officer who does background checks on the  contenders. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t have enough.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Inside the auditorium on exam day, the mood was a mixture of stoicism and nerves. The aspiring police officers, most of them men, padded across a cavernous red-carpeted auditorium and seated themselves behind rows of folding tables and fresh exam booklets, tapping their fingers and legs. Among them were Iraq war veterans, officers who had been laid off, schoolteachers, security guards and pizza delivery boys.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh Lord, let&rsquo;s get this over with,&rdquo; said Stephen Omatta, 26, a third-grade teacher from Tracy who said he wanted a career change. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired of it. State exams? Don&rsquo;t even get me started.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Chiew Kuang, a fuzzy-haired 23-year-old who grew up in East Oakland, approached the exam room doors quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a dream of mine, ever since I was a kid,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>The recruitment is the first major hiring campaign since 2006, when the city spent more than $1 million on advertising for recruits, according to city records. In 2008, the department established a Web site and a recruiting hotline, and it bought a van, a trailer and the pickup truck, emblazoned with a now erroneous claim: &ldquo;testing monthly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That recruitment effort began after voters in 2004 passed Measure Y, a parcel tax to finance violence-prevention programs and the salaries of community policing officers. Mayor Ron Dellums pledged in 2008 to raise the department&rsquo;s staffing levels to 803 officers. When it attracted few job seekers, the City Council authorized the use of more than $7 million of Measure Y funds.</p>\r\n<p>The city has had difficulty finding solutions to the staffing difficulties. Faced with more immediate budget problems, council members consistently rejected proposals to rehire laid-off officers who did not require expensive training, leading to new costs for the education of rookies. In November, voters rejected a parcel tax that could have helped finance the police.</p>\r\n<p>While some initiatives &mdash; a separate academy for recruits from other departments, the rehiring of 10 officers and a program for officers who will be placed in schools, financed by a federal grant &mdash; have helped slow the attrition rate, the number of officers continues to drop.</p>\r\n<p>Recruiters have visited community colleges and sent job postings to the N.A.A.C.P. and other groups, even as the department has grappled with tremendous challenges. As the Police Department&rsquo;s response to the <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/occupy-movement/story/occupy-oakland-provides-lens-deep-opd/\">Occupy Oakland protests was scrutinized across the nation</a>, a federal judge ordered the police chief, Howard Jordan, to begin reporting to a monitor after several missed deadlines in a police misconduct case.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the difficulties of policing the state&rsquo;s most violent city, the department received 2,300 applications for the open positions. About 60 percent of the 1,330 applicants who took the test are expected to pass and move on to a physical exam, followed by an interview with a panel of police officials and residents and a background investigation.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Look how many people are here today,&rdquo; said Eddie Silva, 26.

The mandate is at the heart of the legal challenge, and supporters say that the Act cannot survive without it.</p>\r\n<p>That may be true. But the mandate, no matter how important, is just one part of the law, and most of the pieces that have taken effect so far are much more popular.</p>\r\n<p>One is a requirement that insurance companies let families keep their adult children on their policies until age 26. Before the law was passed, adult children who were not in college were typically knocked off their parents&rsquo; family coverage, and many then went without insurance. It&rsquo;s estimated that more than 350,000 young California adults are taking advantage of this provision to keep their coverage.</p>\r\n<p>Another major change is a provision prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage to children with pre-existing medical conditions. Once this rule took effect, some insurers doing business in California said they would simply stop selling kids&rsquo; coverage. But a new state law now requires them to sell those policies if they want to sell any insurance here. So families with sick kids now find it easier to get coverage for them.</p>\r\n<p>Adults with pre-existing conditions can still be denied private coverage, until 2014. But in the meantime, California, using new federal money, has expanded a high-risk pool for people who have been shut out of the private insurance market. Nearly 9,000 people who were without coverage before have been accepted into that program.</p>\r\n<p>Every Californian with private coverage is also benefitting from other parts of the law. One provision prohibits insurance companies from imposing lifetime limits on the costs that people can have covered. Another phases out the annual limits on costs that many insurers have included as part of their policies. Still another piece of the law requires insurance companies to provide preventive care without out-of-pocket costs.</p>\r\n<p>And there is more. A major goal of the Act is the expansion of coverage for low-income Americans who have not received coverage through work, could not afford to buy it on their own but did not qualify for public programs designed for the very poor.</p>\r\n<p>With new federal money, California counties are creating or expanding what are known as Low-Income Health Plans, similar to the Medi-Cal program, but for people with higher incomes or who do not have children. So far, nearly 400,000 people in 47 counties have been enrolled in these programs. In 2014, they will become part of Medi-Cal, and the federal government will continue to pick up the cost of their care.</p>\r\n<p>California has also begun implementing what could become the most important piece of the new health care system: the creation of a Health Benefits Exchange. This will be an online marketplace where businesses and individuals can shop for coverage. The plans will be standardized and grouped into levels of coverage &ndash; gold, silver, bronze &ndash; so that consumers can see clearly what benefits are available and how much each plan would cost, including deductibles and co-payments. Subsidies will be available for consumers with incomes up to four times the federal poverty level, or nearly $90,000 a year for a family of four.</p>\r\n<p>The Exchange is expected to facilitate coverage for several million Californians who don&rsquo;t have insurance now. Others will move to the Exchange if they lose employer-based coverage. Health insurance experts expect some employers to drop their coverage once the Exchange becomes a viable alternative for their workers, despite financial penalties for doing so. Eventually, the state-run marketplace could become the biggest seller of insurance in California.</p>\r\n<p>All of this has been done without the mandate on individuals that will be the subject of next week&rsquo;s Supreme Court hearings.</p>\r\n<p>The court is expected to rule on the case in June, and unless the justices strike it down completely, the issue will probably be a big part of the presidential campaign later this year. Republicans have vowed to repeal the law if they get the chance, even though their likely nominee, Mitt Romney, signed a very similar plan when he was governor of Massachusetts.</p>\r\n<p>But even if Romney or another Republican is elected president and the Republicans take control of the US Senate, it&rsquo;s unlikely they will follow through with their threat to repeal the entire law.</p>\r\n<p>Many pieces of the Act are popular even with Republican voters and the business community, and the parts expanding coverage for the poor are really more about the safety net than insurance.</p>\r\n<p>So unless the Supreme Court invalidates the entire law, the Affordable Care Act, or most of it anyway, is probably here to stay.</p>", "slug": "health-reform-already-affecting-most", "title": "Health Reform Already Affecting Most Californians "}}, {"pk": 13702, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"float: right; width: 50%; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 0px;\" title=\"A sketch of the Rickshaw Obscura, one of the 20 or so new exhibits that the Exploratorium's outdoor team is designing\" longdesc=\"Courtesy of the Exploratorium\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/rickshaw-obscura/original/exploratorium06_adi_web.jpg\" alt=\"Rickshaw Obscura\" />When Shawn Lani biked to work at the Exploratorium in San Francisco on a recent sunny morning in March, his thoughts turned to light.</p>\r\n<p>The sunlight peeking through the shadows of buildings and trees reminded Lani of the rickshaw obscura, a mobile camera obscura to be housed inside a rickshaw. Within a few hours, he had pulled his exhibition team members away from their computers and loaded them into a small trailer, which they took turns driving around the Marina, searching for the best views from the pinhole camera.</p>\r\n<p>It was a typical workday for Lani, senior artist and head of a team of exhibit designers at the Exploratorium who are working feverishly to prepare for the move of this celebrated science museum to its new home on the Embarcadero.</p>\r\n<p>After over four decades at the Palace of Fine Arts in the Presidio, the museum, founded by Frank Oppenheimer, is scheduled to open at Piers 15 and 17 next year.</p>\r\n<p>Like the original Exploratorium, the new site will feature a unique sensibility of artistic savvy mixed with a Bay Area feel and will be home to a wild mix of the highly creative, hands-on exhibits the museum is famous for.</p>\r\n<p>And for the first time, some of the exhibits, like Lani&rsquo;s rickshaw obscura, will be outdoors.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>By the time a reporter showed up to spend time with Lani and the outdoor exhibit staff, most of the five-member team was sequestered inside a small white trailer, giggling as they watched the parking lot projected on the floor via a small hole cut in the top of the trailer&rsquo;s roof and an angled mirror and lens.</p>\r\n<p>Why all the experiments? &ldquo;I got distracted by the light beams,&rdquo; Lani said with a goofy smile.</p>\r\n<p>The outdoor program is about placemaking, a word used by both Lani and Tom Rockwell, director of public exhibition at the Exploratorium, to describe the Exploratorium&rsquo;s goal of bringing the museum into the fabric of its environment. One and a half acres of space in and around the piers will feature work that is free and open to the public in addition to interactive pieces accessible only in the ticketed area.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the 30 or so outdoor exhibits, the new nine-acre, $300 million Exploratorium will feature a cafe, four open gallery spaces, the Bay Observatory, a 200-seat theater and two pedestrian bridges connecting various parts of the piers.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We decided to treat the site as a campus,&rdquo; Rockwell said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about the building, but the space around and between the buildings.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>With so many outdoor installations using the natural environment &mdash; like Bay Windows, five large glass discs showing a collection of sediment from the bay; or Remote Rains, an area that will shower a &ldquo;rainstorm&rdquo; on visitors, with the size of the water drops determined by data gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration &mdash; the new Exploratorium will be uniquely tied to its surroundings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the city is the museum,&rdquo; Rockwell said.</p>\r\n<p>%13131%</p>\r\n<p>The genesis for the outdoor team came almost a decade ago, according to Rockwell, after the museum secured the waterfront property. And then, in 2009, the museum received a grant to build a smattering of outdoor exhibits (called the Outdoor Exploratorium) around Fort Mason.</p>\r\n<p>The placemaking approach is in vogue right now, as many arts and science institutions look to deepen their relationships to their surroundings.</p>\r\n<p>For example, the creation of a new wing for the Fisher collection, the sprawling private collection of Don Fisher, founder of the Gap clothing company, provides the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art with an opportunity to add more entrances and tweak its public face.</p>\r\n<p>The new design opens side streets like Natoma and Minna to museum visitors. &ldquo;To use a term from the art world,&rdquo; said Neal Benezra, director of the museum, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s creating cultural institutions that are site-specific.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As Lani roamed around the office, it seemed striking how much had not been completed &mdash; and how relaxed the team appeared. According to Rockwell and Lani, that is part and parcel of the museum&rsquo;s philosophy of tinkering. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not just a museum. We&rsquo;re kind of a creative lab or studio,&rdquo; Rockwell said.</p>\r\n<p>But iteration takes trial and error. As he fiddled with a plywood board with holes punched through it, Lani explained his incipient plans for the Lath House &mdash; a wooden structure with intersecting beams that will allow for interesting shadows to form depending on the angle of the sun (or light source). He wanted to make the shed move around but seemed unsure about what exactly he was trying to show with the shadow play. Hence, his impromptu plywood experiments.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It will rotate slowly,&rdquo; he said, his eyes on the round shadows formed by the board. &ldquo;But what is it supposed to do?&rdquo; Dusting off his knees, Lani described his process thusly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just obsessively looking,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times. </em></p>", "slug": "exploratorium-embarcadero-museum", "title": "Sometimes a Museum Needs to Get Outdoors More"}}, {"pk": 13703, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom; width: 100%; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" title=\"Retired Judge Vaughn Walker, center, performs on the stage at the Verdi Club in San Francisco, March 19, 2012, during Porchlight, the popular San Francisco storytelling event\" longdesc=\"Adithya Sambamurthy/The Bay Citizen\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/vaughn-walker/original/walker03_adi_web.jpg\" alt=\"Vaughn Walker\" />As he had many times before, Judge Vaughn R. Walker &mdash; impeccably dressed in a gray suit and muted red tie &mdash; took command of the room.</p>\r\n<p>It was not a courtroom, but the Verdi Club, the site of a law-and-order-themed evening of storytelling hosted by San Francisco&rsquo;s Porchlight storytelling series on Monday night.</p>\r\n<p>Walker, recently retired from Federal District Court, became something of a local celebrity after his 2010 ruling that Proposition 8, the voter-approved California measure that banned same-sex marriage, was unconstitutional. He became even more of a lightning rod after it was revealed that he is gay. So expectations ran high when he took the stage under yellow and purple lights and the flash of a disco ball, telling the crowd that he had been told not to expect a typical legal audience. &ldquo;That, I assume, was a compliment to you,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>He quipped about how, in the courtroom, he was not used to being accompanied by a piano player, particularly &ldquo;one that I know when I go on too long is going to start playing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Marc Capelle, who was at the piano, played a few bars of the theme music from the &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; television show.</p>\r\n<p>The audience roared.</p>\r\n<p>Walker, 68, was the headliner for an evening that included Matt Gonzalez, the former San Francisco supervisor; Maurice Caldwell, who was imprisoned for 20 years for a murder he did not commit and was released last year; and Ren&eacute;e Paradis, an appellate lawyer.</p>\r\n<p>It was Paradis who recruited Walker to appear on stage. &ldquo;I just cold-called him through the State Bar of California website,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>Walker has worked about 8,000 cases as a lawyer and presided at 250 to 300 trials in his 21 years as a federal judge &mdash; including Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the Proposition 8 case, and Apple Computer v. Microsoft Corporation, a copyright infringement case &mdash; so he had a few stories to choose from.</p>\r\n<p>%105%</p>\r\n<p>He did not choose to talk about his more high-profile cases, but instead picked the tale of a plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney gone bad: a man of Eastern European origins who lived lavishly, with a big house and a yacht that he paid for by recovering large amounts of money for his clients. He got into trouble when he began spending the money before the clients got access to it.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Once you start a scheme of that kind, it&rsquo;s going to unwind on you,&rdquo; Walker said in his authoritative baritone. &ldquo;And it began to unwind on him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The attorney had a number of clients &mdash; he helped farmworkers in the Napa Valley who were given substandard housing, a woman who fell in a synagogue and a couple whose twins were born with cerebral palsy because of an error at a fertility clinic.</p>\r\n<p>But like the others, when the twins&rsquo; parents &ldquo;went to claim what was due them, it wasn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; Walker said, repeating his refrain with an actor&rsquo;s enunciation.</p>\r\n<p>The crowd seemed to like everything about him, including his looks.

But AC Transit officials, enamored with European public transit, have only bought buses from <a href=\"http://www.vanhool.be/\" target=\"_blank\">Van Hool, a Belgian company</a>, since 2002.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I felt kind of disappointed,&rdquo; said Tejeda, whose two sons, Cesar and Adolfo, also work at the plant. &ldquo;I felt underestimated about the quality of my job.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Gillig finally won a contract last week from its hometown transportation agency when AC Transit agreed to buy 40 buses from the company for $16.4 million. With more than 100 buses rolling out of the Hayward plant every month, the order was relatively small, but it was a symbolic victory for Tejeda and other Gillig employees.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>AC Transit had a change of heart after the Teamsters union, which represents most of Gillig&rsquo;s 700 employees, <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ac-transit-chooses-teamster-employer-to-manufacture-buses-2012-03-16\" target=\"_blank\">flexed its political muscle</a> in the down-ballot races for the agency&rsquo;s board of directors. The Gillig order was also spurred by the public outcry over money that the cash-strapped agency spent to send its officials on regular trips to Europe, including the salary and expenses of a bus inspector who lived near the Van Hool plant in Belgium.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We used to have some guy in Europe fully paid for by AC Transit keeping an eye on all the manufacturing. It just didn&rsquo;t make sense,&rdquo; said Elsa Ortiz, an agency director who pushed to buy buses from Gillig. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re buying from a company that&rsquo;s in Hayward just 10 miles away. It&rsquo;s local jobs; it&rsquo;s improving the local economy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Gillig, which was founded in 1890 to build horse-drawn carriages, is a throwback to an era when manufacturing was king and American workers stayed in the same jobs for decades. Gillig employees earn an average of $40 an hour in salary and benefits. After 25 years, workers receive an all-expenses-paid Hawaiian vacation for themselves and their families.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; width: 50%; margin-right: 15px;\" title=\"The Gillig bus manufacturing plant in Hayward\" longdesc=\"Zusha Elinson/The Bay Citizen\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/gillig-plant/original/Gillig.jpg\" alt=\"Gillig Plant\" /></p>\r\n<p>Alameda County has lost 33,000 manufacturing jobs in the last decade, and it is still struggling to rebound from the recession, yet Gillig has continued to build buses without layoffs at its plant near the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge. Most bus companies in the United States have disappeared, and those that remain are foreign-owned or make only portions of their buses here. Gillig is the only remaining American-owned transit bus company that does all its manufacturing in the United States, according to company officials and industry experts.</p>\r\n<p>But even as the loss of American manufacturing jobs has become an issue in the presidential election, political gridlock in Washington is threatening companies like Gillig. The federal transportation bill, which used to be routinely renewed every six years, has become a battleground as Republicans try to cut spending on public transit.</p>\r\n<p>Although the Senate has passed a two-year transportation bill, the House, unable to settle its differences, has simply kicked the can down the road, extending financing for only a few months at a time, a path it took once again this week. The result is that transit agencies around the country, which depend on the federal government for most of the money they need to buy buses, cannot plan far enough in advance to place orders, said Joe Policarpio,  vice president for sales and marketing at Gillig.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been very, very difficult for our customers to plan, and there is a decrease in market demand,&rdquo; Policarpio said.</p>\r\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; float: right; width: 50%; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 15px;\" title=\"An AC Transit bus, made by the Belgian company Van Hool, stops at the Transbay Temporary Terminal in San Francisco Tuesday\" longdesc=\"Sarah Rice for The Bay Citizen\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/ac-transit-bus-1/original/6856552016_4312d55da1_b.jpg\" alt=\"AC Transit Bus\" /></p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.apta.com/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">American Public Transportation Association</a> found in <a href=\"http://www.apta.com/resources/reportsandpublications/Documents/APTA-Impact-House-Cuts-2011.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a study last year</a> that three-fourths of companies serving the public transit industry had flat or declining revenues because of the uncertainty around federal transportation financing and the recession. Policarpio said that bus orders were down 25 percent industrywide.</p>\r\n<p>Because of the low demand for buses and trains in this country, there are virtually no major American-owned manufacturers. When the <a href=\"http://www.bart.gov/about/projects/cars/faq.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Bay Area Rapid Transit agency put out a bid</a> for a $3.4 billion fleet of 775 train cars in 2009, only foreign companies responded. A Canadian company, Bombardier Transportation, <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/transportation/story/bart-bombardier-blamed-chicago/\" target=\"_blank\">is the leading candidate</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The U.S. is way behind the rest of the world when it comes to public transit,&rdquo; said Paul Oversier, assistant general manager for operations at BART.</p>\r\n<p>Aside from Gillig, there are other companies that build trains and buses in this country. Because of so-called Buy America laws, transit agencies using federal money must purchase rail cars and buses from companies that produce 60 percent of the total value of the vehicle in the United States. That means most foreign companies have manufacturing plants here.</p>\r\n<p>But ordering from foreign companies means extra costs. BART has already spent more than $95,000 in travel expenses this year for employees to visit France, China, South Korea, Mexico, Canada and cities around the United States to inspect plants run by Bombardier and the other two bidders, Hyundai Rotem of South Korea and Alstom of France.</p>\r\n<p>In December, rail cars made by Bombardier in Chicago were recalled because of faulty parts made by a Chinese supplier, highlighting the need for the inspectors, Oversier said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is an example of why the owner needs to be aggressive and do their due diligence when the cars are being designed and built,&rdquo; said Oversier, who declined to comment on how the Chicago recall might affect Bombardier&rsquo;s bid.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>At AC Transit, the Belgian-made Van Hool buses have their fans. Chris Peeples, a longtime agency board member, said the European company produced far more advanced buses than Gillig.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our direction to our general manager was to bring a bus over that would embarrass the U.S. bus industry into making a decent bus, and I think we succeeded,&rdquo; Peeples said.</p>\r\n<p>Peeples said that Gillig was not willing to build the buses that AC Transit wanted for its rapid lines &mdash; buses with three doors and low floors. But critics said the Belgian buses did not deliver on all the company&rsquo;s promises.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They were sold to the board on the basis of, you know, how we elite Americans tend to think that everything is done better in Europe, so there was this feeling that if you want good transit, go to Europe,&rdquo; said Greg Harper, who is also on the AC Transit board. &ldquo;They just didn&rsquo;t turn out to be any of those things. They weren&rsquo;t better priced; they weren&rsquo;t better made.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Gillig makes buses for transit agencies nationwide, including the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority in the South Bay and SamTrans in San Mateo County. The company is the second largest manufacturer in North America, making between 25 percent and 35 percent of the 4,000 to 6,000 buses produced here every year, Policarpio said. But the AC Transit contract was cause for extra celebration.</p>\r\n<p>Lyle Funderburk, 37, who installs the rear exit door on the buses, said that his children would point to AC Transit buses on the streets and ask, &ldquo;Daddy, you built that bus?&rdquo; and he would answer, &ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Now, Funderburk said, &ldquo;I can tell them, &lsquo;Daddy put that door on that bus.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times.</em></p>", "slug": "made-hayward-bus-maker-finally-wins", "title": "Made in Hayward: Bus Maker Finally Wins a Local Contract"}}, {"pk": 13705, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>Alicia Montiel Rodriguez was in an office building in southern Mexico City Tuesday when alarms began to sound, piercing the air with beeping tones and recorded messages warning that an earthquake was on its way.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We followed the instructions of the security people and went to preassigned safety zones within the building,&rdquo; Montiel Rodriguez said in Spanish. &ldquo;About 10 seconds after everybody got to their zone, the earthquake started.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Mexico&rsquo;s early-alert earthquake warning system was established after 10,000 people were killed by a <a href=\"http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1985_09_19.php\" target=\"_blank\">magnitude 8 temblor in Mexico City in 1985</a>.

But officials who have been working on the program say much more is needed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The main problem is funding,&rdquo; said Doug Given, a project manager for the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s earthquake monitoring program. &ldquo;In the current government financial situation, it&rsquo;s unlikely that it will be funded to the adequate level soon. We&rsquo;re still searching for avenues to make it happen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Developing such a system in the Bay Area and elsewhere in California, areas that are crisscrossed by fault lines, is more difficult than in Mexico, where shaking is predominantly caused by offshore earthquakes that can take tens of seconds to reach the coastline and seconds more to stretch into populated inland areas, according to&nbsp;Thomas Heaton, the Los Angeles-based director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory at the&nbsp;California Institute of Technology.&nbsp;Tuesday's quake struck inland, 12 miles below the earth's surface.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>The demonstration project in California already works &mdash; to a limited extent &mdash; using an existing network of earthquake sensors to warn researchers of approaching shaking as it spreads like ripples on a pond away from an epicenter.</p>\r\n<p>The nascent system relies on rapid computer analysis of data from about 400 of the nearly 1,000 sensors managed under the <a href=\"http://www.cisn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">California Integrated Seismic Network</a>, said Heaton, who is&nbsp;involved with the system's development.</p>\r\n<p>The key is analyzing the data from those sensors and sending the results electronically faster than the speed at which earthquake shock waves travel, roughly two miles per second.</p>\r\n<p>While it used to take 30 minutes for geologists to map and project the path of an earthquake, Heaton said computers could now be programmed to make those calculations in seconds.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s basically what early warning is &mdash; you&rsquo;re making the projections as quickly as possible. In the case that you make it fast enough, the projection comes before the shaking,&rdquo; Heaton said.</p>\r\n<p>But funding woes mean the early-warning system is plagued by too many errors, and crashes too frequently, to be rolled out for transit operators, utilities, building managers and others in California for whom it could be useful. Heaton said at least 200 additional sensors would be needed to provide sufficient data for an accurate early-warning system.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You just can&rsquo;t unleash a buggy system,&rdquo; Heaton said.</p>\r\n<p>Even advance warning of five to 10 seconds could be enough to slow trains before tracks buckle. Elevators could be routed to the nearest floor and their doors opened to prevent passengers from becoming trapped by a blackout.

The city said consumers have done such a good job in recycling that they have less trash, so that now the city&rsquo;s garbage fund is going broke.</p>\r\n<p>Palo Alto has been using money from collecting garbage to pay for the recycling, which, for residents, is free.</p>\r\n<p>It seems that Palo Alto is not the only city facing this financial dilemma. Most cities on the Peninsula encourage residents to conserve by using smaller trash containers, so they are also seeing their income drop drastically. Each is struggling to right the ship.</p>\r\n<p>In January, San Mateo County hiked its garbage-collection rate by 14.7 percent in some unincorporated areas, including Burlingame Hills, San Mateo Highlands, Baywood Park and others.</p>\r\n<p>Last December, Belmont approved a trash-rate hike of 11.6 percent for residents and businesses, and San Carlos now charges residents 5.3 percent more for garbage collection.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s ironic is the better we do in recycling, the more unsustainable our rate structure is,&rdquo; said Phil Bobel, Interim Assistant Director of Public Works for Palo Alto.</p>\r\n<p>The refuse fund, which the city uses to pay for its trash collection, recycling, composting, and street sweeping services, has been losing money for several years. According to a city report, the fund has a budget deficit of $3.7 million for this fiscal year. The revenues shortfalls can, in many ways, be attributed to the city&rsquo;s success in encouraging conservation through what it calls its &ldquo;Zero Waste&rdquo; program. By switching to smaller cans, residents bring down their trash bills and, in doing so, reduce the city&rsquo;s revenues. In addition, more people are recycling, for which the city has not been charging its residents.</p>\r\n<p>That, however, may soon change.</p>\r\n<p>Bobel said the city expects to charge residents for a broad range of services, including garbage collection and disposal, yard-waste collection and processing and recycling collection and processing.</p>\r\n<p>Palo Alto&rsquo;s City Council began dealing with this issue last year when it added a flat rate of $4.62 to each residential bill, regardless of can size.</p>\r\n<p>But on March 6, the council&rsquo;s finance committee endorsed a proposal to add an additional $2.09 fee for street sweeping and additional fees to pay for the city&rsquo;s hazardous waste collection and processing.</p>\r\n<p>A recently completed &ldquo;cost of service&rdquo; study by the city proposes even more significant changes. Under a suggested model, Palo Alto would start charging residents $7.66 for recycling, and $10.99 for picking up their yard trimmings. Residents who use mini-cans would see their monthly refuse rates jump from $20.52 to $45.46, a 121 percent increase. Residents who use the standard 32-gallon cans would see their monthly rates go up from $37.58 to $50.48, a 37 percent increase.</p>\r\n<p>However, on March 6 the committee and staff opted not to go that far but to pursue a series of small, incremental increases instead.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are suggesting phasing in.&rdquo; Bobel said. &ldquo;We would take baby steps.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>By increasing the rates, city officials said they are also trying to bring the refuse system into compliance with Proposition 218, a state law that bars cities from setting rates that exceed the cost of providing the services for which these rates are charged.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Any changes we are making are really to address Proposition 218 and the results of our cost-of-service study,&rdquo; Public Works manager Brad Eggleston said during the Finance Committee&rsquo;s meeting.</p>\r\n<p>However, some residents have been outspoken in opposition of the rate hikes.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They just raised my rates a year ago or so, and now they are at it again,&rdquo; wrote an anonymous a resident of the Crescent Park neighborhood, on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=24569\" target=\"_blank\">Palo Alto Online</a>&nbsp;website March 7, &ldquo;They are doing much less work, picking up much less trash, and demanding more money.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The resident, who was joined by many other online commenters who were against the rate hikes, added. &ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The whole trash issue is never gonna end,&rdquo; wrote Malcolm Fartze, a resident of the Fairmeadow neighborhood, on the same day. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for our politicians to do what is right and stop the act.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Despite the high costs, the city&rsquo;s waste-reduction efforts are expected to accelerate in the coming years.</p>\r\n<p>The city&rsquo;s goal, which the council adopted in 2004 and called &ldquo;Zero Waste&rdquo;, is to divert almost all waste from landfills by 2021. The city&rsquo;s diversion rate right now is 80 percent, Bobel said.</p>\r\n<p>But each step toward &ldquo;Zero Waste&rdquo; might bring a greater financial challenge. For ratepayers, this means that even if they reduce their trash loads, rates are still likely to go up.</p>\r\n<p>Because the city can no longer not afford to completely subsidize recycling, Bobel said, it may have to look for other incentives to encourage residents to recycle and conserve. The city has also been trying to let residents know about the true costs of garbage collection, including the costs to the environment.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The cost of going green is going up,&rdquo; Foster City&rsquo;s Mayor Art Kiesel said in November when the city council approved a 6.4 percent increase to garbage rate for 2012.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;People living in the area don&rsquo;t recycle just because it&rsquo;s a nice thing to do,&rdquo; Bobel said. &ldquo;We recognize that it&rsquo;s part of the changing behavior, and we have to pay for the price of it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Whatever happens, the environment will likely benefit, even though the bottom line doesn&rsquo;t. And for ratepayers in the area, this may soon be the only remaining solace.</p>", "slug": "recycling-increases-garbage-rates-rise", "title": "As Recycling Increases, So Do Garbage Rates"}}, {"pk": 13713, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee has given Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi a deadline to resign Tuesday afternoon or face removal proceedings, sources told The Bay Citizen.</p>\r\n<p>The mayor gave the sheriff the ultimatum during a Monday afternoon meeting that lasted approximately 15 minutes, the sources said.</p>\r\n<p>Susan Fahey, a&nbsp;spokeswoman for the sheriff, said Mirkarimi&nbsp;&ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t given me an indication one way or another&rdquo; regarding whether he plans to step down.</p>\r\n<p>Reporters waited for a decision from Mirkarimi outside of his office Tuesday afternoon.</p>\r\n<p>News of the ultimatum came shortly before an attorney for Mirkarimi's wife, Eliana Lopez, held a press conference to respond to charges that Lopez&nbsp;repeatedly pressured two neighbors to \"destroy evidence\" against the sheriff and \"lie to police.\"</p>\r\n<p>The allegations were made by the couple's neighbor, Abraham Mertens, in an op-ed published in Tuesday's San Francisco Chronicle.</p>\r\n<p>Lopez's lawyer, Paula Canny, refuted the claims, saying her client was&nbsp;\"about to have a nervous breakdown, as am I.\"&nbsp;Lopez had planned to attend the noon press conference, but decided not to after the publication of the op-ed, Canny said.</p>\r\n<p>In the article, Mertens called for Mirkarimi to \"resign immediately\" and urged San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee to remove Mirkarimi if he refuses to step down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lee said Tuesday morning that he would hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon to comment on the case.</p>\r\n<p>When asked if he thought Mirkarimi should resign given Mertens' allegations, Lee said, \"It's up to Ross to decide.\"</p>\r\n<p>At her news conference Tuesday, Canny said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they can properly remove Ross on the grounds they&rsquo;ve cited.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To the mayor, please respect the electoral process,&rdquo; she said.<strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>Mertens is the husband of Ivory Madison, whom Lopez contacted on Jan. 1, the day after she and Mirkarimi allegedly had an argument that resulted in a bruise on Lopez's arm.

In this part of Richmond, the natural mixes closely with the industrial: construction equipment and piles of scrap metal standing a quarter of a mile high jutted obtrusively into the view of the sun on the water. From the dock, a group of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) representatives quietly watched a snorkeler on the side of a small pontoon boat as he pulled on bright blue flippers. A minute later, he slipped off the edge, and with a small splash, he was in the water, swimming toward a deflated soccer ball floating in the middle of Lauritzen Channel, a trail of bubbles tracking behind him.</span></p>\r\n<p>The soccer ball was tied to a basket of mussels embedded in the sediment at the bottom of the channel. In the past, when EPA officials attached the mussels to a normal buoy, people would steal them, possibly thinking they were lobster traps, says Penny Redding, an EPA project manager for the Lauritzen Channel. The soccer ball deceptively looks like a piece of trash floating in the water, which protects the mussels from thieves.</p>\r\n<p>The mussels will give scientists and the EPA an estimate of how much DDT&mdash;a carcinogenic and nerve-damaging chemical&mdash;is left in the area. The chemical is a part of a toxic stew left behind by the chemical company United-Heckathorn when it went bankrupt and abandoned the site in 1966. The EPA cleared more than three tons of pure DDT in 1996 during a massive cleanup effort. But it didn&rsquo;t completely clean the area. The Lauritzen Channel has more DDT in it than before the 1996 cleanup, and some fish are turning up with DDT levels in their tissues hundreds of times higher than their counterparts in the rest of the San Francisco Bay. It took one company less than two decades to create a chemical mess in the Lauritzen Channel that will take almost half a century to identify and clean. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 1947, Prentiss &amp; Co., a New York based chemical company, sent Eugene Heckathorn to Richmond to supervise a DDT-grinding plant, meant not for manufacturing but for processing and distribution, on the Lauritzen Channel. He intended to stay in California for only a short time, but he liked the West. He bought the DDT-grinding plant from Prentiss and quickly merged with United Chemical Co. to start an insecticide company&mdash;United-Heckathorn. &ldquo;Heckathorn soon built a reputation for doing the jobs no one else wanted,&rdquo; boasted one article in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>in 1958.</p>\r\n<p>Though United Heckathorn worked with other chemicals, like dieldrin, processing DDT accounted for 95 percent of its business. United Heckathorn imported technical grade DDT from Montrose Chemical Corporation and Shell Oil Company ground it into a powder in air mills or chemically converted it to a liquid. The company then packaged and shipped it out as an agricultural insecticide and as a combatant to malaria. United Heckathorn expanded exponentially and by 1958 it was producing more than 25 billion pounds of liquid DDT and enough insecticide to treat more than eight million acres of farmland.</p>\r\n<p>The dangers of DDT weren&rsquo;t known while United-Heckathorn was an active company, but now, decades later, scientists have extensively studied and documented the dangers. The United States banned DDT in 1972 after studies linked exposure to breast cancer, diabetes, miscarriages, and neurodevelopment problems in children. It resists organic decay, persisting in an ecosystem for decades. As fish and plants absorb the chemicals into their tissue and cells, and birds eat them, they spread the chemicals through the food chain, creating a perpetually dangerous cycle.</p>\r\n<p>United-Heckathorn&rsquo;s housekeeping policies, though, reflected the ignorance of the time. These chemicals weren&rsquo;t considered dangerous and even if they were, no one was there to scold them or stop them. &ldquo;It was a little bit of a standard of the time,&rdquo; said Rusty Harris-Bishop, a superfund division liaison for the EPA. &ldquo;Folks just didn&rsquo;t pay attention to that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When employees dumped the powder form of DDT from one transport container to another, clouds of dust flew out and spread over the area. Pipes running under the Lauritzen Channel leaked and spills weren&rsquo;t cleaned.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; float: right; width: 50%;\" title=\"Rusty Harris-Bishop, an EPA representative, strongly advises residents against fishing in the channel.\" longdesc=\"Courtesy Richmond Confidential\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/ddt-richmond-2/original/sign.jpeg\" alt=\"DDT RIchmond 2\" /></p>\r\n<p>In 1966, United-Heckathorn went out of business and abandoned its factory on the Richmond harbor. A few years later, the buildings were demolished and shortly afterward dead fish started floating to the top of the water. The California Department of Fish and Game noticed a milky liquid oozing from Lauritzen Channel. While the EPA&rsquo;s Penny Reddy isn&rsquo;t sure if the dead fish and the DDT were related, she said it was a red flag that the ecosystem wasn&rsquo;t healthy.</p>\r\n<p>In 1982 the EPA declared the Lauritzen Channel a superfund site, meaning it is officially designated as a hazardous site in need of serious cleanup. In 1990, the EPA put it on the national priorities list. Six years later, the EPA dredged the bay, cleared soil from the site, and put concrete caps on some areas. It cleaned three tons of pure DDT from a 100,000 cubic yard area and cleared three feet of pure product from the top portion of the soil.</p>\r\n<p>But dredging and cleaning equipment wasn&rsquo;t as effective then as it is now, and large amounts of contaminants were left in place. For example, the EPA couldn&rsquo;t reach areas under piles of scrap metal, under docks, or near barriers. It also turns out that the clamshell dredges used to pull up mud ended up spraying water and sediment everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>&rdquo;What we have learned since then is that 50 percent of those efforts have failed,&rdquo; said Kelly Manheimer, EPA site manager for the Heckathorn Site. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know that at the time. We thought it was the perfect thing to do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Years of boats coming in and out of the bay shuffled the soil on the bottom and DDT spread throughout the channel again. By 2011, DDT concentrations exceeded 1994 levels. Something had to be done.</p>\r\n<p>Cleaning up old industrial sites is tedious. Before the process can start, the EPA needs to run tests. And without accurate maps, in this case marking where United-Heckathorn stored and processed DDT, the agency has to play detective to determine where the highest levels of pollution might be. They are testing the soil and water, and even using mussels to measure the pollution levels. Mussels are natural barometers for aquatic health because they are static and absorb everything in the water flowing past. The EPA gathered mussels from Bodega Bay, a relatively clean area, and put them in the Lauritzen Channel for a month. At the end of the month, the EPA officials stood on the edge of the dock and watched a scuba diver emerge and hand over a muddy bag of mussels to a scientist in a pontoon boat before pulling himself up.</p>\r\n<p>A scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will examine the mussels, but the results won&rsquo;t be ready until July. And then they will have to be bundled with sedimentation and water samples before the EPA can start to draft a cleanup plan, which has to go through its own bureaucratic loopholes before it can implemented. &ldquo;We have this whole process,&rdquo; Redding said. The EPA won&rsquo;t actually start dredging and cleaning until 2015 and even then, it will likely take many years.</p>\r\n<p>As the EPA representatives, scientists, and scuba divers wrapped up and left the dock the day remained gorgeous &mdash; a stark contrast to the unseen DDT that will linger in the water for decades.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span><br /></span></p>", "slug": "richmond-harbor-has-dangerous-levels-ddt", "title": "Dangerous Levels of DDT Pollution in Richmond Harbor "}}, {"pk": 13717, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>A gray whale was spotted between Angel Island and Tiburon on Saturday and near Sausalito on Sunday.

Lee, who made affordable housing a key issue in his election campaign last fall, convened a series of meetings beginning in January to devise a plan for replacing tens of millions of dollars in housing subsidies that the city lost when Gov. Jerry Brown dissolved redevelopment agencies across the state last year.</p>\r\n<p>For Lee, this issue is personal; he got his start in public life as a legal advocate for immigrant renters.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Housing is one of his top priorities,&rdquo; said Christine Falvey, Lee&rsquo;s spokeswoman. &ldquo;He campaigned on it, and now he has worked very successfully in his first year as mayor in bringing different people together to shape a policy.&rdquo; She added, &ldquo;A policy that has broad support.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But with a May objective for producing ballot measures to raise money for new housing subsidies, Lee&rsquo;s Housing Trust Fund Work Group seems to have served mainly to demonstrate that, while everybody purports to oppose high rents in this city, they cannot agree on how to solve the problem.</p>\r\n<p>The people Lee has gathered for his Trust Fund Work Group represent some of San Francisco&rsquo;s most fiercely oppositional interest groups. They include nonprofit developers, builders of high-rise condominium buildings, builders of small apartment buildings, managers of city-subsidized housing complexes, and smart-growth environmental advocates.</p>\r\n<p>Although the group has not reached consensus on how to come up with more housing subsidies, one thing is clear: With the recession, budget cuts and downturns in local construction and real estate industries, there may be so many interests competing for pieces of a potential housing trust fund that they could undermine plans to pass a ballot measure to pay for it.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;let&rsquo;s carve out housing&rsquo; and expect it&rsquo;s going to be a simple thing,&rdquo; said Peter Cohen, co-director of the Council of Community Housing Organizations, which lobbies on behalf of nonprofit housing developers. &ldquo;There are union contracts. We&rsquo;re entering into the budget season. There are people raising concerns about employees. There&rsquo;s tension. The city&rsquo;s general fund is not big enough for everything.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The simple solution &mdash; asking voters to approve new taxes earmarked for subsidized housing &mdash; is viewed as impractical in the current political climate, because specific-use taxes require two-thirds approval. So the participants in the mayor&rsquo;s Housing Trust Fund Work Group are considering, among other ideas, a strategy to raise tens of millions of dollars in annual housing subsidies &mdash; first through a ballot initiative to increase taxes on the sale of existing properties, and then by passing a second ballot initiative that would allocate those revenues specifically to subsidize housing costs for lower-income residents.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008, and again in 2010, city leaders floated the idea of raising taxes to pay for more housing subsidies. In both instances, tax increases passed at the ballot box, but plans to earmark the money for housing foundered. The money went into the city&rsquo;s general fund, where it was pounced upon by a variety of other interests.</p>\r\n<p>Like most cities, San Francisco has been hurt by the recession. Job growth has long outpaced the number of housing units being built, and an economic recovery will only worsen the imbalance.</p>\r\n<p>According to California&rsquo;s Employment Development Department, the counties of Marin, San Mateo and San Francisco hosted 952,100 jobs. Meanwhile, the 2010 U.S. Census counted just 659,187 housing units in those three counties.</p>\r\n<p>During the 1990s and 2000s San Francisco permitted about one-third of the housing units that would have been required to keep pace with population growth, according to the city&rsquo;s Planning Department. And the Association of Bay Area Governments predicts that by 2030 the Bay Area will add 1.4 million jobs, yet will add only 605,000 new housing units.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>As a result, at the end of 2011 an average two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco rented for $3,267 per month, up from $2,840 a year earlier, according to the real estate services firm Cassidy Turley. In March, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group, proclaimed San Francisco to be America&rsquo;s costliest city for rentals.</p>\r\n<p>Building enough housing to meet demand is politically difficult in a city whose population density is the highest in the western United States. Further complicating matters is the city&rsquo;s tradition of community activism. The Planning Department has counted more than 400 neighborhood organizations and related groups, many formed over the years to battle against housing project proposals that came and went. The city must usually negotiate with these groups when new construction is proposed.</p>\r\n<p>So, politically, the trick for San Francisco politicians has been to favor reduced rents without actually proposing to build enough new apartments to meet demand. As a result, political discussions about housing tend to focus on low-income housing subsidies.</p>\r\n<p>The city&rsquo;s realtors have already circulated flyers objecting to the idea of a new tax on property sales, called a transfer tax.</p>\r\n<p>San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener has proposed routing more subsidies toward middle-income residents, which in San Francisco can mean people earning $90,000 per year.</p>\r\n<p>Randy Shaw, executive director of the nonprofit Tenderloin Housing Clinic, said he backs the mayor&rsquo;s plan to raise money for new subsidized housing. But Shaw said he believes around $7 million of the money should go toward raises for&nbsp;staff members of nonprofit housing agencies, including his&nbsp;300 or so employees. &ldquo;There really is enough money there,&rdquo; Shaw said. &ldquo;We need to look at housing, but along with other priorities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Many of the city&rsquo;s labor unions, meanwhile, are in contract negotiations and are seeking more money from the city&rsquo;s general fund, the same source of money that housing advocates hope to tap.</p>\r\n<p>Sean Keighran, president of the Residential Builders Association, a local construction trade association, said he favors new housing subsidies but would like to see an end to local rules that require his members to pay for subsidized units in every building they make. &ldquo;The industry needs some relief,&rdquo; Keighran said. &ldquo;Unemployment is 30 percent in construction.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>S. Osborn Erickson, chairman of the Emerald Fund, a local developer, said any deal involving a transfer tax increase must include an easing of a city requirement that 15 percent of the units in any apartment project be subsidized by the developer to make them affordable to lower-income tenants. The key to reducing rents, Erickson said, is encouraging market-rate housing construction.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re just going to raise the transfer tax, that just makes it more difficult overall to provide housing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If, however, it&rsquo;s coupled with reducing affordable requirements, that&rsquo;s a way to do it where everybody wins.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Cohen, whose organization&rsquo;s members have sometimes supported neighborhood-improvement groups in opposing market-rate housing projects, countered that the city should allow developers to build apartments only after the city has extracted the maximum possible fees to pay for subsidized units.</p>\r\n<p>Shaw, who says any deal must set aside millions for his workers, said he does not believe the mayor will allow the Trust Fund discussions to be held hostage by any one faction. &ldquo;This is not going to happen here because the mayor won&rsquo;t tolerate it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m confident of a positive result here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times.</em></p>", "slug": "many-arguments-no-agreements-affordable", "title": "Many Arguments, No Agreements on Affordable Housing"}}, {"pk": 13721, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>Recent sightings of a gray whale and her infant calf swimming near Alcatraz and Sausalito in San Francisco Bay illuminated a likely repercussion of melting polar ice, scientists said.</p>\r\n<p>Gray whales normally mate in the tropical lagoons of Baja California in the winter, migrate north to chilly polar waters to feed on shrimp-like prey that blanket ocean floors in the spring and summer, and return to Mexico the following winter to give birth in the lagoons, where the young are protected from sharks and orcas that hunt in the open ocean.</p>\r\n<p>But the relatively small size of the calf that followed its wayward mother into the Bay &mdash; about that of a newborn, which is 15 feet &mdash; indicated that its mother calved as she migrated south along the coastline &mdash; just as others of her kind are heading north for the summer feeding grounds.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing more and more calves born before they get all the way down to Mexico,&rdquo; said Wayne Perryman, leader of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&rsquo;s cetacean  health and life history program at the agency&rsquo;s office in La Jolla.</p>\r\n<p>Researchers have been cataloguing changes in the population&rsquo;s feeding and migration patterns.

These include an inability to afford bank fees,  bad credit histories that bar people from opening accounts and being misinformed about the need for government-issued identification to open an account.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, low-income people are disproportionately unbanked: the national F.D.I.C. survey from 2009 found that about 40 percent of unbanked people in the Bay Area earn below $30,000 a year, and Latino and black residents are most at risk of not having an account. This echoed research from 2008 from the Brookings Institution, a public policy think tank, finding that most of San Francisco&rsquo;s estimated 36 payday loan stores and 104 check cashers are concentrated in low-income, Latino neighborhoods.</p>\r\n<p>The City of San Francisco has two programs meant to help more people open traditional bank accounts. Last year, it started CurrenC SF, a program aimed at getting businesses and employees to use direct deposit. Bank On, a program developed in San Francisco in 2006 and now used nationally, gets partner banks and credit unions to offer low-risk starter accounts with no minimum balance requirements.</p>\r\n<p>But efforts at curtailing the growth of fringe banking have been met with a strange paradox: national banks like Wells Fargo are also financing fringe institutions. The San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, for instance, headed a group of banks giving DFC Global Corp., the owner of Money Mart, $200 million in revolving credit, according to federal filings.</p>\r\n<p>In an email, a Wells Fargo spokesman defended its actions: &ldquo;Wells Fargo provides credit to responsible companies in a variety of financial services industries.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But even with the exorbitant fees and sky-high interest rates, the fringe financial shops do provide much-needed services. Outside Money Mart, Macias said that he wished banks gave him products similar to  the check-cashing operation.</p>\r\n<p>Stuhldreher agreed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot financial institutions can learn from check cashers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re convenient. Some are open 24 hours. Their fees are too high, but they are transparent.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times. </em></p>", "slug": "unbanked-and-financial-fringes", "title": "'Unbanked' and on the Financial Fringes"}}, {"pk": 13725, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"float: right; width: 50%; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 0px;\" title=\"Rubmaps.com features an interactive map of adult massage parlors and user-submitted reviews of masseuses\" longdesc=\"Adithya Sambamurthy/The Bay Citizen\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/green-door-massage-parlor-review/original/prostitution03_adi_web.jpg\" alt=\"Green Door Massage Parlor Review\" /></p>\r\n<p>This week, as I reported <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/crime/story/flourishing-sex-sites-boon-police/all/\" target=\"_blank\">a story about websites that have replaced Craiglist.org</a> as sources of sex-for-pay advertisements, I received a call from Warren Newsome, who said he was a spokesman for rubmaps.com, a site that features an interactive map and user-submitted reviews of adult massage parlors throughout the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike many websites I found out about through police, rubmaps.com has a clean and modern website design. User reviews for each massage parlor appear beneath a map and photograph of the facility. A form and drop-down menu allow users to describe, in vivid detail, their experience with each masseuse, including age range, breast size, pubic hair style and the types of sexual services offered.</p>\r\n<p>Newsome was the only spokesperson, out of several sites I contacted, who responded to a request for an interview. Here&rsquo;s our conversation, condensed for clarity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Warren Newsome: </strong>Let me just say up front, I&rsquo;m not the owner of the site. The owner of the site is named Halen. She does this as a sort of personal hobby site. I help her out as a spokesperson for free because I&rsquo;m her friend.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Bay Citizen: </strong>Who is she?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newsome: </strong>Halen has an extensive history in the adult industry as an independent marketer. She did this for fun about a year ago. She never thought this site would turn out to be as big as it is right now.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TBC: </strong>What&rsquo;s her last name?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newsome:</strong>&nbsp;She has a family, and she&rsquo;s not looking for her three kids to know she&rsquo;s involved in this activity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TBC:&nbsp;</strong>How did rubmaps start?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newsome:</strong>&nbsp;What happened was she noticed there was a huge gap [on adult websites]. People didn&rsquo;t have a medium to share their experiences for physical locations, like massage parlors, strip clubs and whatnot.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p><strong>TBC:</strong>&nbsp;Who runs the site?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newsome:</strong>&nbsp;I believe she has a design team. I think imitation is the most sincerest form of flattery, and so she originally designed it to look like Yelp. I think Halen has about 10 employees. We have a staff that goes through businesses one by one.</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s 10,000 places licensed in the U.S. We add about 20 to 50 daily. Users add them, but we have to approve them to make sure they&rsquo;re not some public property, like a Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s ice cream shop.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TBC:</strong>&nbsp;That sounds like a fairly big operation. How do you support it?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newsome: </strong>A lot of it is volunteers. Some of it may be incentivized in certain ways. Surprisingly, the site hasn&rsquo;t made a dollar. It&rsquo;s 100 percent just community-based, out of the kindness of her heart. Once the company believes they have a lot of readership, then they might try to add advertisements here and there.</p>\r\n<p>Right now, we get like 100,000 unique visitors a day. Halen gave me the stats, and we have politicians, doctors, people in the military using our site. She showed me their email addresses, so we know. We have guys who are in their 20s and 70s, and females who sign up.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TBC:&nbsp;</strong>A lot of law enforcement officers say rubmaps.com is basically facilitating sex trafficking at massage parlors. On the site, there&rsquo;s a form for users to specify a masseuse&rsquo;s breast size, how her &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; is groomed, and whether or not she performs oral sex, etc. How would you respond to law enforcement&rsquo;s concerns that rubmaps is helping facilitate prostitution, potentially of trafficked women?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newsome:</strong> We, at rubmaps, we&rsquo;re strictly against facilitating sex trafficking. Being a female, the owner is not for that at all. We work closely with law enforcement to help shut down massage parlors that facilitate sex trafficking.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TBC:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have examples of that?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newsome:</strong> Well, if you go to Google News, and plug in rubmaps, you can see several examples&hellip; <em>[Ed. Note: A Google News search performed by The Bay Citizen did not produce any examples of massage parlors that had been shut down with the help of rubmaps.com.]</em></p>\r\n<p>The interesting part is that a lot of the reviews on the site are fantasy. There&rsquo;s no way to validate that any of the stuff is actually true. I know that Halen, when she made the site, it looked a lot different than how it does now. She had an open forum where people could submit what type of functionality they wanted. People were saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to know what color hair the provider has.&rdquo; So we added a drop-down menu. If 90 percent of the users tomorrow said we want to know which girls eat pepperoni pizza, then we would put that as a drop-down menu. It&rsquo;s all very user-generated. If law enforcement goes into one of these massage parlors and conducts a raid and busts the johns, then you know what? Those johns put themselves at risk for being there.</p>\r\n<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s sort of an open forum. They have the option to leave those fields blank, too. Let&rsquo;s say, as a lot of guys do, I went to this massage parlor and I just got a massage. That&rsquo;s all I wanted, and that was my happy ending because the massage was so excellent. Those boxes are there for convenience. And this site is actually pretty useful for women, too, who want to avoid these types of places.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TBC:</strong>&nbsp;Are you at all concerned about being held liable for what happens between provider and john?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newsome:</strong> I believe that Halen has an international law firm that represents her on retainer. There&rsquo;s a couple different laws that protect the freedom of speech and also insulates the website owners from any repercussions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TBC:&nbsp;</strong>So what do you do for a living, Warren?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newsome:</strong>&nbsp;I do some real estate, some investing on the side. I&rsquo;m just across the board. I&rsquo;m actually located in Romania. I&rsquo;m here for about six months.</p>", "slug": "interview-sex-site-spokesman", "title": "Interview with a Sex Site Spokesman"}}, {"pk": 13726, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>A transportation company responsible for installing defective parts on Chicago's subway cars is the leading candidate to&nbsp;build BART&rsquo;s $3.4 billion fleet of new train cars, The Bay Citizen has learned.</p>\r\n<p>Bombardier&nbsp;Transportation&nbsp;outscored two other companies in the bidding process to build BART's new fleet, General Manager Grace Crunican said Friday in a memo obtained by The Bay Citizen.</p>\r\n<p>Chicago Transit Authorty inspectors found that Bombardier&nbsp;installed defective parts made by a Chinese supplier on new rail cars, the Chicago Tribune reported. Initially, the firm only wanted to replace the most damaged parts, according to the newspaper.</p>\r\n<p>The Canadian company&nbsp;must still undergo a rigorous audit before BART staff decides to recommend it to build the cars, said Paul Oversier,&nbsp;assistant general manager for operations at BART.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Top BART officials say replacing the cars is the most expensive and important undertaking at the transit agency, which covers 104 miles and carries more than 300,000 riders every day.&nbsp;The 775 new cars will be designed by BMW and will feature&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/bart-seats-2/story/designs-new-bart-cars-feature-easier/\" target=\"_blank\">easy-to-clean seats</a>. They will begin rolling down the tracks in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Bombardier began manufacturing 706 new cars for the CTA in June, after winning a $1.14 billion contract. But in December, the CTA took the first 54 cars Bombardier delivered off the tracks, after inspectors found flaws in the wheel components. The Chicago Tribune <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-09/news/ct-met-cta-train-probe-0309-20120309_1_rail-cars-cta-president-forrest-claypool-cta-officials\" target=\"_blank\">reported last week</a> that defective steel parts manufactured by one of Bombardier&rsquo;s Chinese suppliers could cause derailments.</p>\r\n<p>Molly Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the CTA, said that its inspectors first identified a problem with a part that helps attach the wheels and axels to the rail cars in November. The discovery was made at Bombardier's U.S. assembly plant, and the problem was traced to a Chinese foundry.</p>\r\n<p>The company then shut down production, and the CTA took the trains containing the parts out of service, while Bombardier performed an internal investigation. After CTA insisted, Bombardier agreed to replace the parts in all of the trains.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sullivan downplayed the Tribune report about possible derailments.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our experts told us that there was very little risk, and had there been any, it would have been years down the road,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>Maryanne Roberts, a spokeswoman for Bombardier, said Friday that BART riders shouldn't worry about the safety of the company's rail cars.</p>\r\n<p>\"There are literally thousands of parts on a car and this was just one part &mdash; it was found before there was any safety issue,\" Roberts said.\"It was an issue with a sub-supplier that has been replaced. We've stepped up our already-strong control process.\"</p>\r\n<p>Roberts called the Tribune report \"exaggerated,\" adding that there was \"never any fear of derailment.\"</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Oversier declined to comment on whether Bombardier's problems in Chicago would affect whether BART would choose the firm. But he said that transit agencies should learn from what happened there.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is an example of why the owner needs to be aggressive and do their due diligence when the cars are being designed and built,&rdquo; Oversier said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bombardier was the low bidder for the BART car project. It priced a single car at $2.95 million, 2 percent below Alstom, a French firm, and 4 percent below Hyundai Rotem, a South Korean manufacturer. The total cost of each car will be about $5.1 million, after inflation, taxes and other costs.</p>\r\n<p>BART officials scored each bid on several factors&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;price, experience, design, approach to work, delivery speed and energy efficiency, in that order of importance, Oversier explained.</p>\r\n<p>Bombardier must now undergo an audit of how well its bid meets so-called Buy America requirements.&nbsp;Under federal law, transit agencies must buy rail cars from companies that produce 60 percent of the car's total value in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Even though there are no American companies that could build BART&rsquo;s new fleet of cars, some local officials have loudly protested the fact that the winning bidder will be from another country.</p>\r\n<p>Once an audit of Bombardier's bid is completed next month, BART staff will make a final recommendation. The transit agency's board will vote to award the lucrative contract in early May, according to the memo.</p>\r\n<p>Bombardier isn&rsquo;t the only bidder facing scrutiny. The Korean government ordered Hyundai Rotem to recall 19 new bullet trains after a series of breakdowns last year, the Korea Times <a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/05/117_86847.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Bombardier, which also makes planes, has built cars for New York City subway and the London Metro, among others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>BART officials and board members refused to talk specifically about each of the companies involved in the bidding process, owing to concerns about possible litigation.</p>\r\n<p>\"Every car builder, regardless of their reputation, goes through a difficult time,&rdquo; Oversier said. &ldquo;What distinguishes the good carmakers is how they deal with it, and also that it not be an ongoing problem.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Embed:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjKwU8bwmo</p>", "slug": "bart-bombardier-blamed-chicago", "title": "Top Bidder for New BART Cars Under Scrutiny"}}, {"pk": 13727, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom; width: 100%; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;\" title=\"&ldquo;Fragile,&rdquo; by Eiko and Koma, with the Kronos Quartet, at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center\" longdesc=\"Anna Lee Campbell\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/eiko-and-koma/original/Eiko%20and%20Koma%2002_handout_web.jpg\" alt=\"Eiko and Koma\" />Eiko, the female half of Eiko and Koma, the contemporary movement arts duo who have performed together for some 40 years, hurled her small frame onto an oblong pile of canvas and feathers on the floor of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Naked, naked!&rdquo; she said mischievously, gesturing to herself to indicate how she and Koma will appear in &ldquo;Fragile,&rdquo; a new four-hour performance with a score performed live onstage by the Kronos Quartet at the arts center through Saturday.</p>\r\n<p>The evening was an informal preview of the couple&rsquo;s two-week Yerba Buena residency, which also includes performances of three iconic early works and a series of workshops and other events.</p>\r\n<p>Just as quickly, Koma darted from standing to lying down on the opposite side of the nestlike pile. Then he jumped up again and ran to the other side of a large backdrop covered in feathers and salt suspended from the ceiling.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is what people do who don&rsquo;t want to see the naked bodies,&rdquo; he said with a teasing tone, peeking back at Eiko through one of the many holes in the canvas as if he were embarrassed.</p>\r\n<p>If anything characterizes Eiko and Koma&rsquo;s art, it is the slow, even glacial pace of their movements &mdash; sometimes so slow they are almost imperceptible, like ice melting. They describe their work, which evokes a deep connection with nature and deals with elemental themes like nakedness, hunger and death, as &ldquo;infused with relentless stillness that subverts and transcends our everyday notions of time and space.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But when they are not performing, they are anything but still &mdash; flitting around like hummingbirds. &ldquo;We look so serious,&rdquo; Eiko said. &ldquo;But we really aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Eiko and Koma are in San Francisco at the tail end of their three-year Retrospective Project, a series of performances, exhibits and publications examining their four decades of making art.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>They have been residents of New York since 1977. They were born in Japan and arrived in the United States from Europe via San Francisco in 1976. Influenced by Butoh, the postwar avant-garde dance movement in Japan &mdash; where they studied briefly with Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno &mdash; and other expressionist styles, they quickly fell in with the San Francisco experimental dance scene that was exploding at that time.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was love at first sight,&rdquo; said Anna Halprin, the dancer and choreographer who founded the Dancer&rsquo;s Workshop on Divisadero Street in 1955. &ldquo;Their art was completely unique. I invited them to my studio to rehearse and just gave them the key.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Deep bonds were formed and many of their collaborators over the years have been from the Bay Area, including George Coates (&ldquo;Double Vision&rdquo;), Bob Carroll (&ldquo;Nurse&rsquo;s Song&rdquo;), Anna Halprin (&ldquo;Be With&rdquo;) and the Kronos Quartet, which performed a score by Somei Satoh for &ldquo;River&rdquo; in 1997.</p>\r\n<p>The artists remained friends and in 2010 in New York, Eiko and Koma performed an early version of &ldquo;Naked,&rdquo; the work that served as a precursor to &ldquo;Fragile,&rdquo; for David Harrington, Kronos&rsquo; founder and first violinist.</p>\r\n<p>The show brought Harrington to tears. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for how incredibly emotional this is,&rdquo; he said of the experience of sitting just a few feet away from his friends&rsquo; naked bodies, now around 60 years old.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I realized that I was witnessing an absolute center of life, where all layers of protection are removed, where time is irrelevant,&rdquo; Harrington wrote in the 2011 catalog of Eiko and Koma&rsquo;s work published by the Walker Art Center, which also commissioned &ldquo;Naked.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The idea of turning &ldquo;Naked&rdquo; from a &ldquo;living installation&rdquo; (with the artists present whenever the gallery is open) into &ldquo;Fragile,&rdquo; a four-hour performance with live music performed by Kronos, was born.</p>\r\n<p>For the next year and a half, Harrington worked on creating the score.</p>\r\n<p>Inspired in part by the three events Eiko and Koma told him had most influenced their lives &mdash; the atomic bombing of Japan, the 1967-68 student riots, and the tsunami and radiation leaks of 2011 &mdash; he dug into the quartet&rsquo;s repertory and chose music from Wagner, Mahler, Webern, Schubert and others. He also added sound samples, including tsunami destruction reports and the voices of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>\r\n<p>He thought of the music as &ldquo;an offering to them, their nakedness, what they bring to life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The offering is in some ways a challenging one. There is an interesting artistic tension between the string quartet, a refined product of Western civilization, and Eiko and Koma.</p>\r\n<p>To a large degree, Eiko explained, their performance resists the music, which has limitations in the way it is structured and pitched for our species. &ldquo;We take a special pleasure in thinking about ourselves as beyond the human being,&rdquo; Eiko said.</p>\r\n<p>Harrington said the experience was unlike any concert they had done before. He designed the score to have a shape over the four-hour performance, but it &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t have a big coda or anything.&rdquo; The audience is welcome to wander in and out.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I told David, we don&rsquo;t even need the music,&rdquo; Eiko said. &ldquo;As a performer I&rsquo;m not much more than a slime or a maggot.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times.</em></p>", "slug": "performance-relentless-stillness-live", "title": "A Performance of Relentless Stillness, with Live Score"}}, {"pk": 13728, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>A group of domestic violence victim advocates today again called on San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi to resign from office or for Mayor Ed Lee to begin the proceedings to remove him from the post.</p>\r\n<p>Mirkarimi, 50, pleaded guilty earlier this week to a charge of misdemeanor false imprisonment to avoid a trial on charges connected to an alleged domestic violence incident on Dec. 31 involving his wife.</p>\r\n<p>He is scheduled to be sentenced on Monday to three years' probation, 52 weeks of domestic violence classes, 100 hours of community service, and will have to pay nearly $600 in fines and fees along with&nbsp;attending family counseling.</p>\r\n<p>Mirkarimi said following his guilty plea that he does not plan to step down as sheriff, which drew the ire of the couple of dozen advocates who gathered outside City Hall this afternoon.</p>\r\n<p>Beverly Upton, executive director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium, a network of more than a dozen local agencies, called the case \"a national embarrassment for this beautiful, world-class city.\"</p>\r\n<p>Upton and many of the other advocates held a similar news conference two months ago calling on Mirkarimi to step aside after the allegations against him first came to light.</p>\r\n<p>This case \"is about trust, and mine is broken,\" she said. \"We want to send a message to victims and witnesses that they can step forward, that this is a safe city and we care.\"</p>\r\n<p>In agreement was Kathy Black, executive director of La Casa de las Madres, another organization dedicated to helping domestic violence victims.</p>\r\n<p>The group raised money to put up a billboard inspired by the case in the city's South of Market neighborhood last month.</p>\r\n<p>\"The bottom line is we feel it would be improper for the San Francisco sheriff to be overseeing programs and imposing domestic violence sentencing on inmates when he was convicted under similar circumstances,\" Black said.</p>\r\n<p>\"It would be best for everybody involved if he would step aside, and if Sheriff Mirkarimi will not do the right thing, then the mayor and the Board of Supervisors must,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>Under the City Charter, the mayor has the power to suspend Mirkarimi as sheriff for official misconduct, which would lead to a hearing by the city's Ethics Commission.</p>\r\n<p>The Ethics Commission would then make a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors, which would need the approval of nine of the 11 supervisors to remove him from office.</p>\r\n<p>Lee said earlier this week that he is consulting with the city attorney's office on his options, but does not plan to make a decision until&nbsp;after Mirkarimi is sentenced next week.</p>\r\n<p>\"We know Mayor Lee is a very cautious, thoughtful individual.

Law enforcement officials in the Bay Area said other websites had emerged with suspected sex-for-pay advertisements.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: right; width: 50%; margin-left: 15px;\" title=\"Rubmaps.com features an interactive map of adult massage parlors and user-submitted reviews of masseuses\" longdesc=\"Adithya Sambamurthy/The Bay Citizen\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/green-door-massage-parlor-review/original/prostitution03_adi_web.jpg\" alt=\"Green Door Massage Parlor Review\" /></p>\r\n<p>The sites display ads for sex services, and they also serve as online communities where customers, pimps and prostitutes can arrange business deals, share police sightings and swap tips. Law enforcement officials said the online trade has, in some ways, made sex trafficking and solicitation easier, while giving the police new insight into a historically hidden, underground culture.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great tool for us, to be honest,&rdquo; said Detective Jeremy Martinez of the San Jose Police  Human Trafficking Task Force. &ldquo;I know there was a lot of applause when Craigslist&rsquo;s erotic services got brought down, but for us it was a fishing pond we could go to.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Casey Bates, who supervises the Alameda County district attorney&rsquo;s human trafficking unit, said law enforcement officials have &ldquo;a love-hate relationship&rdquo; with online sex sites. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s despicable, what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; Bates said, &ldquo;but they allow us to show a jury in very graphic terms what&rsquo;s going on between provider and john.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Law enforcement officials said the most popular sites for listing sex-related services in the Bay Area include the social media and review website myredbook.com and Village Voice Media&rsquo;s classified advertising site backpage.com. Other sites offer additional features, from lovings.com, which verifies escort-submitted photographs, to rubmaps.com, which features an interactive map of adult massage parlors and user-submitted reviews of masseuses, down to detailed descriptions of their sexual prowess.</p>\r\n<p>On myredbook.com, customers calling themselves &ldquo;hobbyists&rdquo; share reviews of &ldquo;providers,&rdquo; whose photos, phone numbers, services and prices are listed on their profiles. In some forums on the site, other users post photographs of women they see walking on the street, including on &ldquo;Inty,&rdquo; or International Boulevard in Oakland, the notorious stretch for prostitution known as &ldquo;the track.&rdquo; Many post warnings to other users, in real time, when they spot police officers, or claim to have been robbed or ripped off by a pimp, prostitute or customer.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Internet is that frontier out there,&rdquo; Detective Martinez said. &ldquo;Anyone can post, even if it&rsquo;s about something illegal. The good thing about that is we have a place to look.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>At least one site owner does not find the idea alarming.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;These places have been around since the beginning of time, basically,&rdquo; said Warren Newsome, a spokesman for rubmaps.com, the only site to respond to an inquiry from The Bay Citizen. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t play referee. We just provide a forum. It&rsquo;s better to provide this medium where cops can get some info, rather than not have any.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Earlier this month, the San Francisco Police Department received a report that a suspected pimp had kidnapped a young woman at 10th Street and Mission. With a description and photograph in hand, investigators with the special victims unit searched on myredbook.com for the missing woman, filtering the profiles by age and hair color. After finding her profile, a detective contacted the listed cellphone number and arranged to meet with her at a nearby motel, where officers took her into custody.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good way to gather intelligence,&rdquo; said Detective Vincent Repetto of the special victims unit. &ldquo;You get this kind of information and it can dovetail with open investigations.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Late last year, the police in South San Francisco arrested a couple after finding them and two 16-year-old girls, including one runaway, in their motel room. Mahendar Singh, 40, told the authorities that the girls were his stepdaughters, but the police found their profiles on myredbook.com. In January, Singh pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to commit sex trafficking.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Challenging the sites legally has proven difficult. Legal experts said the websites are protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which states that website owners are exempt from responsibility for the content of their users.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The idea is that you hold the speaker liable, and not the soapbox,&rdquo; said Rebecca Jeschke, director of media relations for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the foundation of the Internet you see now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In August, a judge dismissed a lawsuit against Village Voice Media that claimed backpage.com was aiding and abetting sex trafficking by allowing users to post advertisements for sex.</p>\r\n<p>Investigators said that trying to battle the websites in a public or legal arena is not the solution to the problem; providers simply write in code &mdash; offering &ldquo;French lessons,&rdquo; for example &mdash; or move to other websites. Some websites are hosted in other countries, such as rubmaps.com, which lists its business address in Nicosia, Cyprus.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe the best thing to do is to block a site or take it down, but it just pops up in a different form,&rdquo; said Bates, of the Alameda district attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n<p>Lawmakers have been slow to realize the scope of the problem. In 2007, two years after California lawmakers made human trafficking a felony, the attorney general&rsquo;s office released a  report on human trafficking in the state. The Internet was not mentioned.</p>\r\n<p>But California is now leading the country in responding to the rapidly expanding online sex trade. In February, Attorney General Kamala D. Harris convened leaders from nonprofit, law enforcement and technology companies to gather information for an updated report on human trafficking in the state. Several researchers who are a part of the group, including some from Microsoft and the University of Southern California&rsquo;s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, are developing a database that would allow law enforcement officials to search and map information from all of the websites suspected of advertising prostitution.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is an opportunity to observe the social behaviors which underlie the trafficking trade, which is essential if you want to combat it,&rdquo; said Mark Latonero, director of research at the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to crack the code.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times. </em></p>", "slug": "flourishing-sex-sites-boon-police", "title": "Flourishing Sex Sites a Boon to Police"}}, {"pk": 13731, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; width: 100%;\" title=\"The consumption lounge of Berkeley Patients Group, which will close its San Pablo Avenue location on May 1.\" longdesc=\"Frances Dinkelspiel, courtesy Berkeleyside \" src=\"https://citizen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/uploaded/images/2012/3/bpg-interior-2/original/bpgIMG_0853-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"BPG Interior 2\" />Medical cannabis patients in Berkeley will have a more difficult time getting marijuana after Berkeley Patient&rsquo;s Group shuts down on May 1.</p>\r\n<p>California Watch is reporting today that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://californiawatch.org/dailyreport/prominent-berkeley-marijuana-dispensary-close-shop-15320\">BPG has signed a legal agreement</a>&nbsp;with its landlord, David Mayeri, to vacate the premises.

Diablo is one of about 30 health care districts &mdash;&nbsp;out of 74 statewide &mdash; that&nbsp;continue to collect taxes even though they no longer run hospitals. The districts were originally created to provide hospital care to rural and low-income areas.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Piepho, a member of the Contra Costa Local Agency Formation Commission, told the crowd at a meeting Wednesday that dissolving the Mt. Diablo Health Care District was &ldquo;fraught with risk,&rdquo; while&nbsp;reorganizing it was a \"cautious, but maybe more prudent approach.\"</p>\r\n<p>Until this year, state law required voter approval for the dissolution of special districts. But new legislation, which took effect in January, made it easier to disband most special districts without an election.</p>\r\n<p>There is debate about whether voter approval is required to dissolve health care districts under the new law, said Kate McKenna, executive officer of the Monterey LAFCO, and a former deputy executive officer of the California Association of Local Agency Formation Commissions, which represents the state&rsquo;s 58 commissions.</p>\r\n<p>If the Contra Costa LAFCO had voted for dissolution, the Mt. Diablo Health Care District threatened to sue to put the issue on the ballot. Members of LAFCO indicated that they feared that such a suit could be costly and take years to resolve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After urging the commission to dissolve the district, Concord officials agreed to submit an application outlining how the district's&nbsp;day-to-day operations would be overseen by the City Council. The takeover could be finalized by the end of the year, pending the commission&rsquo;s approval.</p>\r\n<p>The district has long been criticized for poor management and waste. Over the last decade, four grand jury reports have called for its dissolution. The small district, which includes Concord, Martinez, Pleasant Hill and parts of Lafayette, has not run a hospital since 1996, yet continues to take in about $240,000 in property tax revenues a year.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>From 2000 through 2007, the district spent only a fraction of its budget on community health programs, financial reports show. Between 2000 and 2011, the district spent just 17 percent &mdash; $527,686 &mdash; of its $3.2 million in property tax and other revenue on community grants, public records show. The bulk of its budget goes to administrative and overhead expenses.</p>\r\n<p>For example, in 2012, the district expects to spend about $16,000, or about 7 percent of the tax revenue it receives, on health insurance for a current board member, a former board member and their spouses. It also owes as much as $800,000 for lifetime retiree health benefits for a current and a former board member.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Critics of government spending seized on the district&rsquo;s inefficiencies at the meeting Wednesday.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This group has squandered hundreds of thousands of dollars,&rdquo; said Kris Hunt, executive director of the Contra Costa Taxpayers Association. &ldquo;Four grand juries came to the conclusion that this district should be dissolved. We agree.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>District officials pleaded for patience.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is no public need or benefit for the dissolution of the Mt. Diablo Health Care District,&rdquo; said Jeff Kasper, chairman of the district&rsquo;s board, who urged the commission to grant the district another year to address its shortcomings.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had the one year many times,&rdquo; responded Commissioner Dwight Meadows. &ldquo;How many times do we give one more year?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>If the reorganization plan is approved, the Concord City Council would serve as the governing board of the district. After the meeting, Daymon Doss, the district&rsquo;s executive director, said it would continue to do its best to address residents' the health care needs.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are going to continue to do business,&rdquo; Doss said. &ldquo;It may have a very different future, but it will have a future.&rdquo;</p>", "slug": "mt-diablo-district-will-be-taken-over", "title": "Concord to Take Over Mt.

Some people have speculated that this unusual combination satisfies pregnant women&rsquo;s increased needs for sodium and calcium, though others say that it&rsquo;s just a self-fulfilling stereotype.</p>\r\n<p>These days, however, it seems like the entire Bay Area has been struck with pickle cravings. Pickles are popping up in sandwiches and salads, or on pickle platters&mdash;even at fine-dining restaurants, which have launched sophisticated &ldquo;pickling programs&rdquo; that reach far beyond the classic cucumber pickle to include all sorts of vegetables and even fruits.</p>\r\n<p>Originally, pickling began as a way to preserve food: submerging food in salty brine or vinegar, produces chemical reactions that kill off dangerous bacteria, while encouraging other, beneficial bacteria. It&rsquo;s kind of counter-intuitive, but it works.</p>\r\n<p>Food historians speculate that pickling began in India four thousand years ago, as an important means of accessing produce, even when they were out of season. Before refrigeration, pickles were often the only source of important nutrients during lean times or long journeys.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, without pickles, Europeans might never have made it to America. In the fifteenth century, sailors regularly fell victim to scurvy, or vitamin C deficiency, on long journeys because they lacked access to fresh produce. But Columbus&rsquo;s ships were packed full of C-rich pickles, which allowed the crews of the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria to survive all the way across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\r\n<p>The man who stocked those ships, Amerigo Vespucci, eventually lent his name to the continent where they landed &mdash; so, in a sense, &ldquo;American&rdquo; just means &ldquo;pickle-ish.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Since then, America has continued to enjoy pickles from all over the world, from English gherkins and French cornichons to Japanese tsukemono and Korean kimchi, though the ethic cuisine most closely associated with pickles is probably that of the Jewish deli. In addition to barrels of sour and half-sour cucumber pickles, the classic deli also offers pickled meats, like pastrami and corned beef, which get their flavor from soaking in brine, like other pickles.</p>\r\n<p>Last month<a href=\"http://wisesonsdeli.com/\">, Wise Sons Deli </a>opened in the Mission District of San Francisco, bringing an old-fashioned Jewish deli to a neighborhood better known for taquerias. This is good news for pickles.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pickle anything,&rdquo; said co-owner Evan Bloom, &ldquo;With a new restaurant, we won&rsquo;t know how much we&rsquo;re going to sell, so all the extra vegetables will get pickled&mdash;that&rsquo;s how pickling got started.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Head Pickler Joe Wolf is excited to incorporate seasonally available vegetables into the Wise Sons pickle plate. While sauerkraut and cucumber pickles will always be on the menu, Wolf will also make pickles from turnips, radishes, beets, Brussels sprouts, broccoli de ciccio, fennel, watermelon rind, and even green tomatoes.</p>\r\n<p>As Wise Sons has evolved from a pop-up restaurant to a weekly Ferry Building vendor to a brick-and-mortar deli with a line out the door, the pickling process has evolved as well. Wolf notes that scaling up from the small batches he used to make has been a learning process, because pickling is more of an art than a science.<img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; float: right; width: 50%;\" title=\"Salt pickles made at Bar Tartine in San Francisco. \" longdesc=\"Chad Robertson\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/pickles-2/original/salt_pickles.jpeg\" alt=\"Pickles 2\" /></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; Wolf said. &ldquo;Small, tiny things can change the outcome. It&rsquo;s really cool to work with a product like that, because I&rsquo;m always at the edge of my seat. It&rsquo;s why we work in kitchens&mdash;to learn, to be inspired.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Nick Balla would surely agree that pickles are exciting for cooks. He can get pretty animated talking about the pickles he&rsquo;s making as chef of <a href=\"http://www.bartartine.com/\">Bar Tartine</a>, in San Francisco, from parsnips with goat&rsquo;s whey to beet-pickled cauliflower.</p>\r\n<p>On a tour of Bar Tartine&rsquo;s pickle-stocked shelves, Balla pointed out the &ldquo;way-pickled ramp bulbs from last year,&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;it takes a long time for them to mellow out, since they have a really overpowering allium flavor.&rdquo; For Balla, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun to serve something as it comes back into season &ndash; 'fun' in a nerdy-cook sort of way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Since taking over as chef of Bar Tartine about a year ago, Balla has steered the menu toward Hungarian food, which is part of his personal background, though his prior experience as a chef was primarily in Japanese restaurants. Both Hungarian and Japanese cuisines have rich and varied pickling traditions, but Balla noted that European pickles tend to have much more vinegar, while Japanese tsukemono (literally &ldquo;pickled things&rdquo;) retain a stronger vegetal flavor.</p>\r\n<p>In any case, Balla said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t follow traditional recipes. We like spices, so we&rsquo;re just going to use them.&rdquo; One batch of fermented cabbage, for example, is pickled in a chili paste made from homemade paprika, anchovies, and smoked dried tomatoes; nearby, curried butternut squash is fermenting in a brine made with fresh turmeric, garlic, chili, and coriander.</p>\r\n<p>For Cortney Burns, who is Project Manager at Bar Tartine and another pickle enthusiast, &ldquo;The best thing about fermented vegetables is the probiotic quality. You can get a full spectrum of probiotics from sauerkraut and other vegetables, for a healthy gut flora.&rdquo; Could probiotics be why the Bay Area has gone crazy for pickles? Are we all responding to an unconscious nutritional need for good bacteria, like pregnant women following the siren song of salt?</p>\r\n<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth: in the process of researching this article, I went ahead and made myself a bowl of chocolate-peanut butter ice cream with dill pickles, and it was delicious.

Wise Sons pickler Josh Wolf offered these guidelines for making old-fashioned dill pickles, but please be advised that these are not hard-and-fast rules.</em></p>\r\n<p>Salt</p>\r\n<p>Pickling Cucumbers</p>\r\n<p>Ice</p>\r\n<p>Dill</p>\r\n<p>Garlic</p>\r\n<p>Cloves</p>\r\n<p>Other spices to taste</p>\r\n<p><em>Dissolve salt in warm water. For half-sour pickles, aim for 4-6% salinity. (That is, a saltwater mixture in which roughly 1/20 of the weight comes from salt.) Let the saltwater cool.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Remove the blossom ends of the cucumbers thoroughly, because they harbor bacteria, and scrape off any residual schmutz (i.e. unidentified dirty stuff) elsewhere on the cucumber.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Old-fashioned pickle barrels were made of oak, but these days, people use NSF Type 2 plastic, which is safe for food storage and can stand up to the acidity of pickles. If you&rsquo;re making a lot of pickles, Husky makes a trash barrel from NSF Type 2 plastic, which works well. Place pickles in the container with fresh dill, garlic, cloves, and any other spices you want.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>If necessary, cool the saltwater brine with ice. The cooler the brine, the crunchier the pickle. You can keep cold, concentrated saltwater on hand to balance the salinity of the brine. Refractometers to measure salinity are available for as little as $25 online.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&nbsp;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em>Weigh the cucumbers down to insure that they are submerged in the brine. It&rsquo;s a good idea to weight them with a bag of brine, in case of any spills.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>For half-sour pickles, leave your cucumbers to ferment in brine for about seven days, optimally at 57-62 degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;&nbsp;For full-sour pickles, you&rsquo;ll need to wait about 21 days. Once you&rsquo;ve reached the desired level of sourness, move the pickles to a refrigerator, where the lower temperature will slow the fermentation, though the pickles will not last indefinitely (unless they&rsquo;re sealed up).

Although California did not permit slavery, he said, the state&rsquo;s charter was by no means progressive toward black people as it denied them the right to public education, to testify in court, to homestead public lands and to vote.</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, San Francisco&rsquo;s black community at the time &mdash; just 464 people in 1852, growing to 1,176 by 1860, about 30 percent of the entire state&rsquo;s black population &mdash; was very politically active, according to Montesano.</p>\r\n<p>The three San Francisco churches, along with others across the state, held conventions through 1865 to change California&rsquo;s racist laws. The laws did eventually come off the books; the education statute was repealed, for instance, by 1880.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The big things in terms of the San Francisco area were the churches, the conventions and the newspapers,&rdquo; Montesano said. &ldquo;The lodges were more like gathering places.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>More recently, though, huge demographic shifts in the city have led the Rev. J. Edgar Boyd, head of Bethel AME, to wonder about the next 160 years of his church. According to the 2010 census, the black population has shrunk to 49,000 &mdash; down by about half from its peak of 96,000 in 1970.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The gentrification that has taken place here is without parallel,&rdquo; said  Boyd. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s affected us like every other African-American church in town.

But those quickly ran out.</p>\r\n<p>Lindsey McWilliams, assistant registrar of voters, confirmed he had heard about the incident. McWilliams said polling places were each allotted only 25 provisional ballots. The complex includes 155 senior households. It&rsquo;s not known how many of the residents tried to vote and were turned away.</p>\r\n<p>McWilliams said poll workers should have allowed all the seniors to vote on the spot, using what is known as a &ldquo;live ballot,&rdquo; which would be verified later. &ldquo;We never turn anyone away,&rdquo; he said &mdash; that is,&nbsp;assuming poll workers &ldquo;were doing what they were supposed to be doing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>When asked why the polling place was moved away from the residence of the seniors, many of whom have limited mobility, McWilliams said, &ldquo;Polling places change with every election.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The votes from the senior citizen complex could be key in a close race. Schivley, 79, a longtime City Council member, believes many of the residents supported her candidacy.</p>\r\n<p>%2144%</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I feel this is election fraud, to say the least,&rdquo; Schivley said in an interview. She said she would wait for the final vote results before determining what action to take, but when asked whether she was prepared to contest the election, she said, &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>This is not the first time that voting in Vallejo&rsquo;s mayoral race has become the focus of controversy. In 2007, Davis won by just two votes after a recount; his opponent's vote tally decreased by seven between the first and second counts. Despite public outcry over the results, no wrongdoing was proven.

He pointed out that since city voters approved doing away with the &ldquo;winner-take-all&rdquo; system in 2002, they re-elected then-Mayor Gavin Newsom and several other city officials without objection.</p>\r\n<p>Avalos also called into question the timing of the measure&rsquo;s introduction on Election Day. He also predicted a signature-gathering effort to put it the ballot if the board rejects the measure.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think it smacks of rabid zealousness,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>Under ranked-choice voting, voters may select up to three candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote an immediate runoff occurs where the candidate with the fewest votes are eliminated and the voter&rsquo;s next choices are redistributed among the remaining office-seekers until one passes the 50 percent threshold.</p>\r\n<p>Last year, ranked-choice voting decided Oakland&rsquo;s mayoral. Jean Quan defeated Assemblyman Don Perata after trailing in the first count of votes.</p>\r\n<p>Supervisor Sean Elsbernd, who backs Farrell&rsquo;s proposal, said the system is responsible for nine out of the 11 supervisors being elected without a clear majority from the outset &ndash; including Farrell, who overcame a first-round deficit to Janet Reilly last year to win the District 2 seat.</p>\r\n<p>Elsbernd, who won his District 7 seat in 2004 under ranked-choice voting, also said the system is undemocratic and was problematic in this year&rsquo;s mayoral race.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I guarantee whoever is elected in today&rsquo;s mayor race will receive less than a majority of votes,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>The board could decide next month if the measure appears on next year&rsquo;s ballot.

It pitted environmentalists against one another. Composting proponents faced off with park advocates.</p>\r\n<p>Although the measure passed with 64.38 percent of the vote, opponents are not ready to give up the fight. &ldquo;There are years of controversy over the issue,&rdquo; said Enid Pearson, a former City Council member who opposes the building of the facility. Despite the allocation of land for its construction, she believes &ldquo;the plant probably won&rsquo;t happen in the future. For the next step, we are going to see what options we still have.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The proposal designates 10 acres of Palo Alto&rsquo;s Byxbee Park for an organic-waste processing facility, or composting site, for yard trimmings, sewage and food scraps. The city offered the ballot measure because it is not allowed to develop parkland unless residents first vote to undedicate the land.</p>\r\n<p>Palo Alto officials say they are pushing the city to become more environmentally friendly, especially in regards to waste management. However, increased recycling is actually costing the city money.</p>\r\n<p>This financial conundrum prompted they city to propose new waste management policies, such as Measure E, it hopes will be both economic and environmentally friendly.</p>\r\n<p>Supporters and opponents of the Measure E debate both argued that their stances complied with the city&rsquo;s economic and environmental priorities. Proponents claim that a local composting site could eliminate environmentally damaging practices in a cost-effective manner. Opponents say the measure would set a dangerous precedent and does not present a financially practicable solution.</p>\r\n<p>The city&rsquo;s goal is to no longer produce garbage for landfills by 2021, and so far, Palo Alto has significantly reduced its waste.&nbsp; From 2007 to 2009, Palo Alto experienced a 44 percent drop in the total amount of garbage it produces. However, this is also creating financial difficulties for the city.</p>\r\n<p>Profits from garbage collection are dropping, and the city is locked into two waste-management contracts that obligate them to deliver a certain amount of garbage to the landfill, or pay for every ton they do not produce. With the city already experiencing a large financial drain due to antiquated waste management policies, the economics of new waste management proposals becomes increasingly important.</p>\r\n<p>The debate over Measure E centered on whether creating a local composting site is the most economic solution for Palo Alto&rsquo;s organic waste management. The measure does not actually establish the type of organic waste management plant to be built. It simply dedicates the land for the possibility of a facility at some indefinite date in the future. Since potential costs of the facility range from $60 million, less than the cost of exporting waste, to over $200 million, dramatically more than the cost of exporting, activists on both sides of the debate claimed to have the most cost-effective solution.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, arguments for both sides have centered largely around the environmental impact of creating a composting site at Byxbee Park.</p>\r\n<p>Those in favor of allocating the land for a compost site say it will allow the city to explore the best solutions for waste management in the future. &ldquo;Support for Measure E allows further research of the waste-to-energy facility options,&rdquo; said Mary Alice Thornton, the President of the League of Women Voters of Palo Alto.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, implementing anaerobic digestion, the composting technology recommended for the new plant, could eliminate the current environmentally damaging practices the city uses for processing sewage.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; width: 100%;\" title=\"In an Energy/Compost Feasibility Study, commissioned by the city in September, the analysis included three different scenarios, for four different kinds of compost facilities at two different cost ranges. \" longdesc=\"Roseann Cima, Courtesy Peninsula Press\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2011/11/compost-parklands-infographic/original/feasibility_study.png\" alt=\"Compost Parklands infographic\" /></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Palo Alto has a dirty little secret,&rdquo; former mayor of Palo Alto Peter Drekmeier said. &ldquo;We are one of two communities left in California that incinerates sewage sludge. With anaerobic digestion, we can retire the incinerator and digest waste products to biogas to power waste treatment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Drekmeier added that a local waste-management solution will decrease the city&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions, from trucks that haul waste to San Jose and Gilroy.</p>\r\n<p>Employees of Acterra, a nonprofit environmental education and action organization based in Palo Alto, say they support the measure because they feel the facility planned for the land could reduce the environmental impact of waste management and reduce the region&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>\r\n<p>Opponents, however, say the process of creating an organic waste management facility will temporarily increase greenhouse gas emissions. Construction on the site of Byxbee Park, a former landfill, would include digging up 200 million cubic feet of garbage, and releasing &ldquo;tons&rdquo; of the greenhouse gas methane.</p>\r\n<p>They also say the passage of Measure E will put extra pressure on the city council to spend resources researching the feasibility of using anaerobic digestion to process all three of Palo Alto&rsquo;s types of organic waste: yard trimmings, sewage and food scraps.</p>\r\n<p>If it passes, the supporters &ldquo;will then use its approval to go to the council and say we can&rsquo;t just let it sit there, we have to figure out how to make it work. So let&rsquo;s spend some money to make anaerobic digestion prove successful. This is not what the city should be doing,&rdquo; said Palo Alto Patch columnist Bob Moss.</p>\r\n<p>Reallocating parkland for another purpose could also set a dangerous precedent, opponents say. The official argument against the measure says, &ldquo;When the government looks to our parks for public works projects, and voters allow it, no park will ever be safe from such land grabs. Once irreplaceable parkland is gone, it&rsquo;s gone forever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Palo Alto Mayor Sid Espinosa has a special stake against the measure. He based his campaign on the promise he would not support reallocating parkland.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of admiral competing objectives,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;like affordable housing. People come and say, &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we take a corner of this park for affordable housing? Or some revenue-generating initiatives like car dealerships, or hotels, could make a lot of money for the city, and that money could go to help sustain our parks.&rsquo; So it can go back into the issue, but once you take away parkland you just don&rsquo;t get it back &ndash; whatever you&rsquo;re putting on it, it&rsquo;s highly likely that it&rsquo;s not going to be parkland.&rdquo;</p>", "slug": "measure-e-palo-alto-parkland-composting", "title": "Composting Measure Pits Environmentalists Against Each Other "}}, {"pk": 13738, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>While San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi on Monday ended the domestic violence case against him by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge, Mayor Ed Lee said today the sheriff's political future is anything but settled.</p>\r\n<p>Mirkarimi, 50, pleaded guilty Monday to misdemeanor false imprisonment in a deal with prosecutors, who agreed to drop three other charges stemming from a Dec. 31 incident in which he allegedly grabbed the&nbsp;arm of his wife during an argument.</p>\r\n<p>Mirkarimi will be sentenced next Monday to three years' probation, 52 weeks of domestic violence classes, 100 hours of community service and a $400 domestic violence fine, and will be required to attend family counseling, prosecutors said.</p>\r\n<p>Lee, speaking to reporters this morning at an unrelated event, said he is consulting with the city attorney's office to determine how to move forward.</p>\r\n<p>\"I know perhaps the lawyers felt that they're settling the case, but our duties are different,\" Lee said. \"Our duties are not to be pled out.\"</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Under the City Charter, the mayor has the option to suspend the sheriff for official misconduct.

Jerry Brown&rsquo;s proposal to cut state aid to caregiver resource centers.</p>\r\n<p>The cuts will touch the lives of women like Audrey, 77, who has relied on the Del Mar Caregiver Resource Center in Santa Cruz for the last five years. She cares for her husband, who has multiple sclerosis and is almost 81. She discovered Del Mar five years ago in what she describes as a period of crisis in their lives.</p>\r\n<p>Audrey uses the center&rsquo;s counseling services and the support groups. She&rsquo;s taken classes at the Caregiver University, an annual workshop that counsels participants on issues like self-care and how to understand dementia or the other behaviors that results from the illnesses of their loved ones.</p>\r\n<p>The current proposed budget calls for all state funding to be withdrawn from resource centers for a savings of $2.9 million statewide.</p>\r\n<p>The proposed budget calls for a total of $10.3 billion in cuts for the 2012-13 fiscal year, with a revision due in May before the budget is enacted in June. Part of the budget hinges on proposed tax measures that could be on the state ballot in November.</p>\r\n<p>There are 11 centers across the state that provide services to caregivers who are providing support to a family member suffering from a cognitive impairment or ailment, such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s, dementia, a brain injury or a variety of other illnesses. Del Mar provides support to Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito counties.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the only agencies that helps caregivers,&rdquo; Audrey said, adding that if the services were cut, she would have to continue to care for her husband at home on their fixed income. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very difficult situation. All the help you get is important.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In the five years she&rsquo;s used the services, they have been integral to helping her cope with the stresses of caregiving.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I went initially, I used the counseling and went to a spousal caregiver support group,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was wonderful. I was really in need. It was a godsend.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>JoAnn Martin, 75, has been caring for her husband for the last three years. She heard about the caregiver support group from a friend. Her husband Gordon, 84, has Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease. She said he started out with tremors and walked slowly at the initial onset of his illness. As it has progressed, he has had trouble swallowing and going to the bathroom.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It just means so much,&rdquo; Martin said, of attending the support group and sharing her concerns about the future. &ldquo;I started back [to the support group] in September 2011 and in that time three women have lost their husbands. You get an advance [look at] the attitude of dealing with death.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>She said though there are support groups for patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s or other illnesses, she said the Del Mar Caregiver Resource Center is the only resource she found for herself.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To lose the funding of an agency that is so powerful at being able to reach out&rdquo; would be troubling for some families, she said.</p>\r\n<p>She added that she does not have a computer so it is difficult for her to find information from other sources so she relies on the support group and the Caregiver University events as a primary source of information.</p>\r\n<p>Since her husband&rsquo;s diagnosis, he has been hospitalized for an extended period and then released into her care on hospice. He went off hospice in April 2011 because his condition remained stable. After an attack of colitis in January, he has started physical therapy.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I can get him up and set him in a wheelchair or set him in other chairs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s constant. I have not been able to hire help.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Audrey can no longer meet her husband&rsquo;s needs on her own. Del Mar provides funding that pays an aide to help her husband shower and gives Audrey a break from the house so she can run errands.</p>\r\n<p>John Beleutz, the executive director of Health Project Centers, which oversees the Del Mar Caregiver Resource Center, sees the proposed cut as having a potentially drastic impact on the clients at the center.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We know family caregivers are at high risk for mental and physical problems,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We try to alleviate that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He noted that when it comes to long-term healthcare, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t most people being in a nursing home. Most are at home being taken care of by family.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Beleutz said the centers, created 30 years ago, have been a model nationwide.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been used in other places and it was really innovative when it came out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He said the centers saw a 72 percent cut to funding a few years ago, but the complete cut of state funding may lead some centers to close their doors. Others will have to drastically reduce services to stay open. He said the state funding is used to leverage other funding &ndash; from private donations, grants or the federal government &ndash; so the cut will hamper their efforts beyond the $2.9 million.</p>\r\n<p>If the cuts go into effect, Beleutz foresees more caregivers moving loved ones into nursing homes.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The annual cost of a nursing home is $74,000 a year &ndash; the national average,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>Del Mar Caregiver&rsquo;s center worked with 700 families last year.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;And there are many more we haven&rsquo;t served, but we could if we had more funding,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>Kathleen Kelly, the executive director of the National Center on Caregiving and the Family Caregiver Alliance, advocacy groups, said her agency estimates that family caregivers provide at least $8,000 in care each year. The amount of funding paid by the state is 50 cents per person.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s kind of interesting is that this program was the first in the country to recognize family caregivers as the major workforce of long-term care and also to recognize and understand there are special stresses and needs of family and informal caregivers,&rdquo; Kelly said. &ldquo;It was signed by Jerry Brown when he was in office the first time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The pilot program began 30 years ago.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly spoke on Feb. 23 before the California Assembly Select Committee on Disabilities in Sacramento urging legislators not to cut the funding to the program. She told legislators that more than 80 percent of the care for those who need assistance either due to a mental or physical disability are cared for by family, a friend or neighbor. There are 5.8 million informal caregivers in California, she said.</p>\r\n<p>The state provides two-thirds of the funding for CRCs, but without the funding they would also lose matching funds of more than $10 million from the federal government under the Older Americans Act, which supports senior programs including the caregiver centers.</p>\r\n<p>In an interview after the testimony, Kelly talked about the changing demographics in California.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done this long-term development in a state that on a percentage basis may not have the largest percentage of older adults, but we certainly have the largest number,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The evolution is that there is less facility care and it is more community based. That is almost entirely predicated on having informal support in the community.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Most of the caregivers are in their 40s or 50s and the majority of them are baby boomer women who are caring for parents or other aging family members, she said. Two-thirds of them work full or part time.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They are providing 20 to 40 hours of assistance a week,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It increases if you have someone with cognitive impairments instead of just physical. They are really working two jobs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Like Audrey, many of the caregivers who use the Del Mar Caregiver Resource Center are supporting a loved one over the long term. Audrey&rsquo;s husband was diagnosed with MS in the 1980s. He has not been able to work since a few years after he was diagnosed, so she said they did not have a lot of money in their retirement. Over the last five years, his health has declined rapidly. She described the experience as putting a frog in a pot of water and gradually bringing it up to a boil &ndash; she didn&rsquo;t realize that she was feeling overwhelmed until it got to a point of crisis.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It got to a point where it was really bad,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly predicted it would be harder for caregivers without the support of the CRCs.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you cut stuff out at the community level, it gets much more difficult for families to juggle all these competing demands,&rdquo; Kelly said.</p>\r\n<p>Kelly said that the burden of caring for a loved one can be especially hard on middle income families that do not qualify for Medi-Cal.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;These are folks making under $50,000 as a household,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t qualify for Medi-Cal and can&rsquo;t afford to pay for services.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The proposed 2012-13 budget can be viewed&nbsp;<a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">online</a>.</p>", "slug": "governor-proposes-cuts-caregiver-centers", "title": "Governor Proposes Cuts to Caregiver Resource Centers"}}, {"pk": 13740, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; width: 50%;\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2011/4/stethoscope-1/original/57260724.jpg\" alt=\"stethoscope\" />It&rsquo;s no wonder there is a hue and cry about an uneven playing field among businesses as they comply with San Francisco&rsquo;s Health Care Security Ordinance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">The law requires most employers to provide health care benefits to workers who put in at least eight hours a week.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">But an analysis of compliance reports submitted by 15 randomly selected employers to the city&rsquo;s Labor Standards Enforcement Office finds that they spent wildly different amounts on health benefits per employee in 2010, the most recent year reported.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">The analysis provides details of a major loophole city leaders tried to patch last fall to recoup an estimated $50 million that businesses put in the bank last year to cover employees&rsquo; health costs but withdrew when employees failed to use it by year&rsquo;s end.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">While some of the differences between health care spending by businesses reflect part-time versus full-time workforces, the differences also reflect how an employer chooses to comply with the law.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Employers have three options: provide health insurance, use the city&rsquo;s own Healthy San Francisco program, or set up health reimbursement accounts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">For instance, A16 Restaurant, a trendy cafe in the Marina district, enrolled most of its eligible employees in health reimbursement accounts, according to its own reporting. The cafe spent $71 per year per employee with those accounts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Wayfare Tavern, an upscale pub on Sacramento Street, spent even less &mdash; $26 per employee &mdash; for all but one of its employees, for whom it spent $3,610. How? It enrolled all but that one employee in health reimbursement accounts, contributed $60,114 into those accounts and paid out only $601 in benefits &mdash; or an average $26 per worker &mdash; recouping the remaining $59,513.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">By comparison, Zuni Cafe, which like the others depends on part-time workers, spent $738 on each of 41 employees it enrolled in health reimbursement accounts. Zuni bought conventional health insurance for 49 more employees.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">And the Marriot International Hotel (admittedly in a different industry with more full-time workers), bought health insurance for 1,901 employees. The hotel spent about $9,368 on each and enrolled 34 more employees in Healthy San Francisco, the health care access plan run by the city, and spent $1,845 on each of those employees, according to the report filed by Marriot with the Labor Standards Enforcement Office.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">The compliance report information was released by the enforcement office through a California Public Records Act request.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Evidence of compliance disparities with San Francisco&rsquo;s Health Care Security Ordinance led the Board of Supervisors to amend the law, effective January 2012.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">The disparities also appear to have spurred the San Francisco civil grand jury to investigate. The citizen commission, which writes independent reports examining the effectiveness of city government, has been questioning people involved with the program in and out of city government about the ordinance and seeking documents. The civil grand jury also interviewed this reporter after the release of a detailed report on the program in the winter edition of the San Francisco Public Press. The commission&rsquo;s report is expected by June 30.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">The landmark Health Care Security Ordinance provides for health insurance for any San Francisco resident by requiring most employers to spend a minimum amount on employees&rsquo; health care benefits and by establishing Healthy San Francisco, a health access plan, for people who do not have employer-based health care coverage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">The 2007 law requires businesses with at least 20 employees and nonprofit organizations with at least 50 employees to spend a minimum on health care coverage for any employee working more than eight hours a week. The minimum currently is $1.46 an hour per worker, which adds up to $607 a year for an eight-hour-a-week worker.</p>\r\n<p>Employers have three ways of meeting that requirement. One is to provide health insurance. Another option is to enroll their employees in Healthy San Francisco. And the third option is to set up health reimbursement accounts and put in a minimum per hour per worker.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">It was that third option, contributing to health reimbursement accounts, that led to compliance problems, although only a small percentage of employers used this option.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><br />After the ordinance was passed, some employers found a loophole in setting up health care reimbursement accounts. They found they could recoup any money in these accounts unspent at year&rsquo;s end. And so they did.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">An analysis last summer by the city&rsquo;s Office of Labor Standards Enforcement of 2010 compliance data found that 860 employers using this option together contributed $62 million to health reimbursement plans&nbsp;for their employees, but spent only $12 million in actual health care reimbursements. They took back the remaining $50 million at year&rsquo;s end.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In fact, half of the companies using health reimbursement plans to meet the requirement were retaining 90 percent of the money they allocated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Noting this &ldquo;raises public policy concerns&rdquo; especially because it coincided with a detectable climb in the number of companies ditching health insurance in favor of&nbsp; reimbursement plans, the analysis caught the attention of Supervisor David Campos. He had heard from workers, particularly in restaurants, who found their benefits gone when they got sick in January. Campos introduced an amendment to forbid employers from taking back any unspent money in health reimbursement accounts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The withdrawals created an uneven playing field among businesses trying to compete because some had lower costs than others did, Campos said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The amendment that passed and was signed by Mayor Ed Lee, however, was a compromise with businesses. Groups like the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce said leaving money in reimbursement accounts would harm small businesses, which could otherwise use the money to hire more workers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The new rules require that employers allow 24 months worth of contributions to accrue in health reimbursement accounts before taking back any unspent money beyond the 24-months&rsquo; worth. The amendment also required employers to actively inform workers that they have the health care benefit and a reimbursement account. One study found there was an incentive in the previous system for employers to not promote the existence of these accounts so employees wouldn&rsquo;t use them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">But Campos&rsquo; office expressed frustration that this solution was merely a patch.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really close the loophole,&rdquo; said Hillary Ronen, Campos&rsquo; chief of staff. &ldquo;Businesses that do follow the rules and provide health coverage to employees through insurance or Healthy San Francisco, they have to unfairly compete with those paying less into health reimbursement accounts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Because employers can still take money back from reimbursement accounts, there is still a monetary incentive, she said, for employers to choose&nbsp; them over insurance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&ldquo;The issues remain,&rdquo; she said, adding that allowing employers to take some of the money back leaves an incentive for&nbsp; employers to limit the type of reimbursable expenses that workers can use.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The Labor Standards Enforcement Office, meanwhile, won&rsquo;t receive reports for 2011 until April. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to tell whether the amendment made a difference,&rdquo; said Donna Levitt, a division manager.</p>", "slug": "san-francisco-businesses-using-legal", "title": "San Francisco Businesses Using Legal Loophole to Skimp on Health Care Cost"}}, {"pk": 13741, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>While Ross Mirkarimi's attorneys were publicly battling to keep jurors from seeing a key piece of evidence against him, they had privately begun discussions with the San Francisco sheriff last week about considering a plea agreement, multiple sources told The Bay Citizen.</p>\r\n<p>Those discussions became more intense over the weekend, after the San Francisco Superior Court's Appellate Division <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/ross-mirkarimi-3/story/jury-can-see-eliana-lopez-video/\" target=\"_blank\">ruled on Friday that jurors could see a video</a> of Mirkarimi's wife, Eliana Lopez, revealing a bruise that she claimed resulted from an argument with her husband on Dec. 31.</p>\r\n<p>The ruling was the latest in a series of setbacks for the legal teams representing Mirkarimi and his wife, who had made several different attempts to persuade judges to exclude the video and other evidence or dismiss the case entirely.</p>\r\n<p>On Sunday night, Mirkarimi and his attorneys finalized the details of the plea agreement.

It is at the entrance to Sobrante Park, a low-income residential neighborhood where more than 850 children live. None of them play at Tyrone Carney Park.</p>\r\n<p>The City of Oakland closed the park almost a decade ago, fencing it off in November 2002, shortly after a drug-related shooting there left one man dead and three others wounded.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The community asked that it be closed because we had five homicides that were at the park or on the sidewalks outside the park,&rdquo; said Oakland City Council President Larry Reid, who represents the area.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Since the park has been closed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had one.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Local community groups are working to reclaim the blighted area.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nobody wants to come through an area that looks like a war zone where things are boarded up,&rdquo; said Cynthia Arrington, 60, co-chairwoman of the Sobrante Park Resident Action Council and the Neighborhood Crime Prevention Council.</p>\r\n<p>After many community meetings, plans have been agreed upon to convert Tyrone Carney Park &mdash; named for a Marine from the neighborhood who was killed in the Vietnam War &mdash; into a landscaped gateway to the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>With the traffic flowing around it, the new entrance to the neighborhood would include a welcome sign and a memorial to Carney, but no picnic tables, park benches or playground equipment.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By redesigning from a park to a plaza, the goal was to optimize the safety, the security and the public access,&rdquo; said Kristine Shaff, a spokeswoman for the Oakland Public Works Agency.</p>\r\n<p>Some remain skeptical that the project can achieve that goal.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Unless they fence it in, there&rsquo;s going to be guys hanging out there anyway,&rdquo; said Don Neuwirth, program manager of the Oakland Schoolyard Initiative, a partnership between nonprofit groups and the Oakland Unified School District, which will be revamping the local elementary school yard this summer.</p>\r\n<p>Construction documents for the new entrance to Sobrante Park are scheduled to be finished this summer at a cost of $200,000. But there is no money yet to actually do the project, which would cost just over $2 million.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the stage now where we can&rsquo;t break ground because Jerry Brown has taken away the redevelopment money,&rdquo;  Arrington said.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Reid and community members are seeking money for the project from foundations, and will also solicit state and federal agencies.</p>\r\n<p>The neighborhood does have another public park, which is still open, next to Sobrante Park Elementary. Yet on a recent sunny Monday afternoon, there were no children playing on the playground equipment there, which members of the Border Brothers gang have tagged with spray paint.</p>\r\n<p>Three Latina mothers waiting for their children at Sobrante Park Elementary next door said in Spanish that they did not allow their children to play at that park, because it was unsafe. Instead, their children play in the schoolyard or at home.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the houses in the neighborhood have fenced front yards.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a vicious circle where because the parks are perceived to be dangerous, they become occupied by people doing bad things, so there&rsquo;s no place for kids to play,&rdquo; Mr. Neuwirth said.</p>\r\n<p>Last month, Victoria Figg, a resident of the neighborhood for 42 years, started a monthly &ldquo;community play date&rdquo; at the elementary school yard. That meant opening it for three hours on Saturday afternoons to give local children an opportunity to play together in a safe outdoor environment on the weekend.</p>\r\n<p>Eighteen families, including 35 children, took part in the free event in February. The children rode scooters, skateboards and bikes. They played basketball with local firefighters.

Eichler lived in one of the two penthouses.

An enclave of about 100 are perched in the Diamond Heights neighborhood in San Francisco, and 185 cluster on a Castro Valley ridge. There are Eichlers in Marin, Concord and San Mateo. In Walnut Creek there is a mini-Eichler, smaller than 500 square feet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>EQUAL OPPORTUNITY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Eichler&rsquo;s houses were a design product of their time, the &ldquo;Mad Men&rdquo; era. The details include floor-to-ceiling windows, radiant floor heating and central atria. Eichler was one of the first developers to open his subdivisions to minority residents. In the mid-1950s, after a black couple bought into a Marin development, neighbors complained and asked Eichler to block the sale. He refused.</p>\r\n<p><strong>AN EICHLER AND A LIKELER</strong></p>\r\n<p>It was widely reported that the childhood home of Steve Jobs, Apple&rsquo;s co-founder, was an Eichler, but that midcentury house in Mountain View was determined to be an Eichler competitor &mdash; what Eichler fans call a &ldquo;likeler.&rdquo; Steve Wozniak, Apple&rsquo;s other founder, grew up in an Eichler in Sunnyvale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HIGH, NOT MIGHTY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Locally, Eichler single-family homes are priced from $500,000 to over $2 million; a Summit condominium recently sold for $2.2 million.

A California state law requires counties to provide health care to people like &nbsp;Chen who cannot afford health insurance and have no other alternatives.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">&nbsp;Chen, a homemaker from San Mateo whose husband lost his job three years ago, had to wait nearly a year to see a doctor through the program. Like thousands of other uninsured people in San Mateo County, &nbsp;Chen waited and waited because the county did not have the money to subsidize her health care.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">At the time, the tax-supported Peninsula Health Care District held a $43 million reserve of current public assets to further its mission statement, which includes &ldquo;responding to the local health needs and allocating resources for programs that enhance the health of the community.&rdquo; The county had asked the district to dip into its reserve to contribute $4 million for subsidized health care for residents like &nbsp;Chen, but the district refused.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">The Peninsula Health Care District is one of about 30 such health care districts, out of 74 statewide, that no longer run hospitals &mdash; a departure from their original mission when, after World War II, the State Legislature allowed communities to levy taxes to support hospitals because the state&rsquo;s rural and low-income areas lacked access to basic hospital care.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">An examination by The Bay Citizen has found that many of these districts stockpile vast reserves and divert money to administrative and operating expenses, including lawyers, election fees and board members who earn lifetime health benefits for part-time work.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">Peninsula Health Care District officials said the county&rsquo;s request for $4 million was rejected because &ldquo;it was completely undefined,&rdquo; said Cheryl Fama, the district&rsquo;s chief executive.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">However, in a letter dated April 6, 2011, county officials told the district: &ldquo;A $4 million annual investment from P.H.C.D. would ensure 6,000 of the district&rsquo;s uninsured residents could rely upon continued access to care and considerably reduce waiting times for primary care appointments.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">The Peninsula district, which serves residents of San Bruno, Millbrae, Burlingame, Hillsborough, San Mateo, and parts of Foster City and South San Francisco, collected $4.2 million in tax dollars in the 2010-11 fiscal year to support community health programs, according to its Web site. But last year it spent just 3.3 percent of its total assets, or roughly $1.8 million, on health-related grants. The rest of the district&rsquo;s budget went mainly to administrative personnel, communications and lawyers &mdash; and into a reserve fund totaling tens of millions of dollars as of June 2011, according to financial reports.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;It makes no sense to have so much money being set aside while there are crying needs in this community,&rdquo; said Margaret Taylor, the former director of the San Mateo County Health Department.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">Oversight of these districts is inconsistent. Some Local Agency Formation Commissions, the State Legislature&rsquo;s watchdogs over special districts providing municipal services, have failed to evaluate how these districts are being run as required by the state, the records show.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">Critics say these districts do little more than manage real estate and distribute grants.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;The outrage factor is we have public agencies that are collecting money that is not being used for the purposes for which the agencies were originally established,&rdquo; said Judy Nadler, a senior fellow in government ethics at Santa Clara University&rsquo;s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics <strong><em></em></strong>and a former mayor of the city of Santa Clara. &ldquo;For a public agency to hold on to that money with the thought that it may be used at some point for some project defies explanation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; &nbsp;Nadler said, &ldquo;how are they helping the public right now by having that money in the bank?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">Many district officials, however, say they act as financial guardians, distributing money to crucial health programs and, in some cases, amassing district assets in case hospital operators fold. Over the years, health care districts have also been criticized by multiple county grand jury reports and by a state watchdog agency that monitors profligate spending. But change is slow.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">For example, four grand juries over the last decade have called for the dissolution of the Mount Diablo Health Care District, based in Concord. The district has not run a hospital since 1996, yet it spent just 17 percent, or $527,686, of its $3.2 million in property tax and other revenue on community grants from 2000 to 2011, according to public records.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">The Mount Diablo district also owes an estimated $800,000 for lifetime retiree health benefits for a board member and a former board member.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">Earlier this year the Contra Costa Local Agency Formation Commission announced that it intended to dissolve or reorganize the district. The commission is scheduled to make a decision on Wednesday. If the plan goes forward, it would be a rare example of one of the state&rsquo;s local agency commissions moving to dissolve a health care district.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">Proponents of the districts say that without them, the health of the community would suffer. &ldquo;Many of these districts provide services that no other agency provides,&rdquo; said David McGhee, chief executive of the Association of California Healthcare Districts. &ldquo;Some of them run clinics, some of them run ambulance services.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">At least three grand jury reports over the last decade about the Los Medanos Community Healthcare District, based in Pittsburg, have gained little traction. The district spent just half of its revenue in the 2010-11 fiscal year on community and health progra The balance, more than $435,000, went to administrative and operating expenses, including stipends for the board of directors, travel and election fees and a board retreat.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">The Eden Township Healthcare District in Castro Valley says on its Web site that it is &ldquo;enabling local organizations to provide much-needed health care services to those in need.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">But the district suspended its grant program two years ago despite a reserve of more than $24 million in public funds. It spends about $450,000 a year on administration, including expenses for the board of directors. It has spent roughly $2.2 million on legal fees over the last three years in an effort to prevent the closing of San Leandro Hospital, which Sutter Health took over in 2004.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">&nbsp;&ldquo;Everything we spend is on community benefit,&rdquo; said Dev Mahadevan, the district&rsquo;s chief executive.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">In 2000, the State Legislature attempted to tighten oversight of special districts by ordering Local Agency Formation Commissions to regularly evaluate how efficiently the districts operate. But at least a half-dozen commissions from Sonoma to San Diego Counties acknowledged that they have not reviewed health care districts as required.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">&nbsp;&ldquo;There is no state agency that is overseeing them to ensure they carry out their duties,&rdquo; said William Chiat, executive director of the California Association of Local Agency Formation Commissions, which represents the state&rsquo;s 58 commissions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">Peninsula Health Care District administrators say they must shore up a $250 million bankroll in case they have to buy Mills-Peninsula Medical Center, a Sutter Health-affiliated hospital whose parent company is leasing the property through mid-2061. But the value of the hospital facilities will almost certainly decrease, from more than $500 million today to $50 million after midcentury, according to estimates by a real estate consultant hired by the district in 2003.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">In the last five years, the health care district has spent $13.5 million for four properties that are being rented to private medical practices, a commercial real estate firm and a cardiac rehabilitation center run by Sutter. District officials said the investment properties would help buttress the district&rsquo;s finances over the next several decades in case the hospital folds. The district also plans to spend about $30 million to build an assisted living facility that would most likely be leased or operated by a corporation specializing in senior care.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">Some public policy experts said the district&rsquo;s endowment-like business strategy is at odds with a core part of its mission: responding to local health needs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Our mandate is not to be the safety net,&rdquo; &nbsp;Fama said. &ldquo;We are here to help provide for all the needs of the community.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">She added that investing in properties is consistent with that mission. &ldquo;Anything we would invest in, they would all be health-related services,&rdquo; &nbsp;Fama said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t treat it as an endowment at all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">The district&rsquo;s board of directors voted Feb. 23 to provide $4.5 million for health-related programs in public schools and a psychiatric residency training program.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">Meanwhile, the number of uninsured residents in San Mateo County receiving subsidized medical coverage doubled to 28,000 over the last three years. An additional approximately 3,000 other people are on the county&rsquo;s waiting list for low-cost medical coverage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">With so much unmet need, some officials suggested that health care districts may no longer be the best way to improve the community&rsquo;s health.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\">&ldquo;Health care districts have become sort of an anachronism in this county,&rdquo; said John Maltbie, county manager of San Mateo County.</p>\r\n<p class=\"body\"><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times. </em></p>", "slug": "uninsured-go-without-care-health-hold", "title": "As the Uninsured Go Without Care, Health Districts Hold Reserves of Money"}}, {"pk": 13750, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p><img class=\"embedLight\" style=\"float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; width: 50%;\" title=\"A reporter interviews Chief Michael Meehan before Thursday's community meeting on the murder of Peter Cukor.\" longdesc=\"Frances Dinkelspiel, Berkeleyside\" src=\"http://media.baycitizen.org/uploaded/images/2012/3/michael-meehan/original/doug.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Meehan\" />Berkeley Police Chief Michael Meehan sent his public information officer to an&nbsp;<em>Oakland Tribune</em>&nbsp;reporter&rsquo;s house in the middle of the night on Friday to push for changes in a story that Meehan thought was inaccurate.</p>\r\n<p>Chief Meehan then twice called the reporter, Doug Oakley, and sent him numerous follow up emails urging him to alter wording in the story about<a href=\"http://www.berkeleyside.com/2012/03/09/community-gathers-in-wake-of-murder-quizzes-berkeley-police/\">a community meeting</a>&nbsp;called to examine Berkeley police response to the Feb. 18. murder of Peter Cukor.</p>\r\n<p>The 12:45 am visit by Sgt.

I don&rsquo;t dispute that it could be perceived badly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>City councilmember Laurie Capitelli, who, along with councilmember Susan Wengraf, convened the Thursday meeting at the Northbrae Community Church to discuss the slaying of Cukor, said Chief Meehan&rsquo;s actions seem out of line.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If the facts are how they appear, it is inappropriate and the chief is overreacting,&rdquo; said Capitelli. &ldquo;The chief is hyper-sensitive to errors made in the papers early on, the stories about the homicide &hellip;. Sending Mary to somebody&rsquo;s front door after midnight is inappropriate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Capitelli said at this point he does not have any plans to ask Meehan&rsquo;s boss, Interim City Manager Christine Daniel, to look into the matter.</p>\r\n<p>Jim Ewert, general counsel of the California Newspaper Publisher&rsquo;s Association, told the Tribune that Meehan&rsquo;s actions were &ldquo;despicable, totally despicable. It&rsquo;s the most intimidating type of (censorship) possible because the person trying to exercise it carries a gun.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This was an official act and it was grossly improper and it calls into question (Meehan&rsquo;s) judgement and his understanding of the role of police in society,&rdquo; said Peter Sussman, a former president of the Northern California chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists who has long been involved with First Amendment issues. &ldquo;It is a serious infraction of privacy, if nothing else. When it&rsquo;s done under the cover of authority it does become state intimidation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In the community meeting, Chief Meehan&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.berkeleyside.com/2012/03/09/community-gathers-in-wake-of-murder-quizzes-berkeley-police/\">complained about inaccurate media reports&nbsp;</a>about the killing, particularly the question of whether a Berkeley police officer offered to go to the Cukor&rsquo;s house before the 911 call came in, but was told not to, and whether police delayed a response because officers were focusing on an Occupy march.</p>\r\n<p>Chief Meehan told the 200 people assembled at the church that he was to blame for not getting information out quickly enough to the community.</p>\r\n<p>Oakley initially interpreted this as an apology for the way Berkeley police responded to the Cukor situation, he said. His story featured this apology prominently.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I went to the meeting,&rdquo; said Oakley. &ldquo;I filed a story about 11 o&rsquo;clock. The editor put it online. I went to bed. The next thing I know my wife is talking to me. I am half-asleep. She&rsquo;s saying the Berkeley police are here. I say &lsquo;what?&rsquo; At first I thought something really bad was happening or they were coming for me, like I was going to be arrested.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sgt. Mary Kusmiss, whom Oakley knows well from his time at the&nbsp;<em>Tribune</em>, was standing at the door.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t want to be here at all,&rdquo; said Oakley. &ldquo;She was really apologetic. She was told to go.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sgt. Kusmiss explained that Chief Meehan had seen Oakley&rsquo;s story and thought he had gotten it wrong. Chief Meehan had apologized for not communicating well with the citizenry, but had not apologized for the police response, she told Oakley.</p>\r\n<p>Chief Meehan had sent her because he could not get through to Oakley by email or cell phone, Sgt. Kusmiss told Oakley. The chief felt he could not wait until morning to get the mistake corrected because the&nbsp;<em>Oakland Tribune&nbsp;</em>has hundreds of thousands of readers, said Sgt. Kusmiss. Chief Meehan did not want bad information out there.</p>\r\n<p>Oakley agreed to make the changes, but told Sgt. Kusmiss it could not happen until around 7 am when there was someone at the&nbsp;<em>Tribune</em>&nbsp;to do it, he said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;At the moment I felt &lsquo;I got something wrong in a really big story and I have to change it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sgt. Kusmiss left, but, starting at around 7:00 am, Chief Meehan continued to press for more changes to the story, said Oakley. He asked for a change to the headline and disputed another section in the story. Oakley declined to make any other changes, he said. But the chief&rsquo;s persistence angered &mdash; and frightened &mdash; him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know when to stop,&rdquo; said Oakley. &ldquo;We both have a lot of power as a journalist and as police chief. We both have to respect that power but I think he really abused it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What does that mean if the chief can send someone over to my house in the middle of the night?&rdquo; said Oakley. &ldquo;Who do you call when the police are after you?&rdquo;</p>", "slug": "berkeley-police-chief-sends-officer-home", "title": "Berkeley Police Chief Sends Officer to Reporter's Home"}}, {"pk": 13751, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>Private companies could build and run hundreds of miles of planned toll lanes on Bay Area freeways, California Department of Transportation officials said this week.</p>\r\n<p>The toll lanes &mdash; which allow single motorists to use carpool lanes for a fee &mdash; are planned for 280 miles of freeways in the East Bay and South Bay.

Last year, San Diego County had to buy its lanes after a private consortium that built them filed for bankruptcy when the tolls were lower than expected.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>But supporters say the deals will help the cash-strapped state pay for big highway projects and reduce the cost overruns and delays that often accompany state-run projects. It was Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger who pushed hard to revive private investment in the state&rsquo;s infrastructure, helping to pass legislation and forming a special commission to review projects.</p>\r\n<p>The push is continuing under Gov. Jerry Brown, who has promoted private investment in high-speed rail. Caltrans officials said five more freeway deals in Southern California are under consideration.</p>\r\n<p>John Goodwin, spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, which oversees the Bay Area's toll roads and which is spearheading the regional toll lane project, said that the agency has not made any decisions on partnerships.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Caltrans&rsquo; assessment is not wrong that a public-private partnership could be employed, but neither is it set in stone,&rdquo; said Goodwin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an option that will be considered in a number of different corridors by different partners, including Caltrans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The MTC has paid legal and financial advisers to explore different ways to pay for the toll lanes, including public-private partnerships, he said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>%323%</p>\r\n<p>A toll lane has already been built on I-680, but it has been slow to generate revenue. Another is on the way for I-580 between Pleasanton and Livermore. Goodwin said that toll lanes on I-880 and 680 are next in line. A decision about whether to hand the projects over to private investors won&rsquo;t be made for another year, he said.</p>\r\n<p>Goodwin said that the Doyle Drive project could pave the way for future public-private partnerships in the region.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That's a breakthrough for project development in the Bay Area,&rdquo; Goodwin said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe to say that the operational success of that project will a go a long way in determining the market for these types of deals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Critics say the deals are unnecessarily expensive financing schemes that toss off fat returns to private investors and that are pushed by politicians who don&rsquo;t want to be seen borrowing money. Academics who have studied public-private parterships warn that the state shouldn&rsquo;t view the deals as easy money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What we are afraid of is that people view public partnerships as free money,&rdquo; said Hiroyuke Iseki, an assistant professor at University of Maryland. &ldquo;The numbers do not get on the government books, but someone has to pay it, whether it&rsquo;s the drivers or the taxpayers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>David Crane, a former senior advisor to Schwarzenegger, said taxpayers will ultimately benefit from the deals, because private companies will drive the price of the projects down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The state needs high-quality infrastructure at the lowest cost and faster pace,&rdquo; Crane said. Without public-private partnerships, he said, &ldquo;California would get lower-quality infrastructure at the highest cost and slowest pace.&rdquo;</p>", "slug": "controversial-privatization-deals-could", "title": "Private Companies Could Run Bay Area Toll Lanes "}}, {"pk": 13752, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>Jurors in San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi's domestic violence trial will be able to see a video that prosecutors have called the crux of their case, a three-judge panel from San Francisco Superior Court's Appellate Division ruled Friday.</p>\r\n<p>Images from the video show a tearful Eliana Lopez revealing a bruise on her right arm. According to court documents, Lopez said the bruise was the result of an argument she had with Mirkarimi on Dec. 31. Lopez's neighbor, Ivory Madison, recorded the video on Jan. 1, during a conversation with Lopez about the alleged incident.</p>\r\n<p>After the trial judge, Garrett Wong, ruled last week that the video was admissable as evidence, Lopez's attorneys filed an appeal, claiming Lopez believed that Madison was an attorney, and that their conversation, including the video, was protected by attorney-client privilege.</p>\r\n<p>In their ruling, the appellate division judges did not explain why they denied Lopez's appeal.</p>\r\n<p>\"We are pleased with the court's ruling and look forward to moving ahead with the trial,\" said Stephanie Ong Stillman, a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office.</p>\r\n<p>Lopez's attorney, Paula Canny, appealed the ruling today to the state Court of Appeal, according to San Francisco Superior Court spokeswoman Ann Donlan. Canny could not be reached for comment Friday evening.</p>\r\n<p>Mirkarimi's attorney, Lidia Stiglich, has filed two separate&nbsp;motions regarding the video, arguing it should not be admissible because if Lopez does not testify in the trial, there is no way for Stiglich to cross-examine her about the statements she made on the video.</p>\r\n<p>\"I don't think any of us should agree that we should be tried by video,\" Stiglich said. \"You can't cross-examine a video.\"</p>\r\n<p>Mirkarimi has pleaded not guilty to three misdemeanor charges: domestic battery, child endangerment and dissuading a witness. If convicted, the sheriff could spend a year in prison and three years on probation.</p>\r\n<p>Lopez has refused to cooperate with the investigation, which began on Jan. 4, when Madison contacted police.</p>\r\n<p>Stiglich filed another motion Thursday in an effort to block testimony by Mirkarimi&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend, Christina Flores, who claimed he verbally and physically abused her during their relationship four years ago.</p>\r\n<p>Flores, an aspiring television personality, testified last Friday and Monday in an evidentiary hearing to determine whether she would be allowed to appear as a witness for the prosecution. Wong ruled that Flores could testify during the trial, because her statements could help establish a pattern of behavior by the sheriff.</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Flores said she filed a police report in January after reading a newspaper account of the charges against Mirkarimi. Flores testified that she and Mirkarimi were involved in an on-again-off-again relationship that lasted from June 2007 until December 2008.</p>\r\n<p>During one argument, Flores told the judge, Mirkarimi yelled in her face and grabbed her arm, leaving a bruise. Flores&rsquo; account of the incident is strikingly similar to what prosecutors allege happened between Mirkarimi and Lopez on Dec. 31.</p>\r\n<p>Stiglich argued in her motion Thursday that Flores&rsquo; statements are &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; and impossible to corroborate. She also suggested that Flores was only motivated to testify by a personal vendetta against the sheriff, because he refused to commit to their relationship.</p>\r\n<p>The motion contains lines from what Stiglich called a &ldquo;lengthy hate poem&rdquo; that Flores emailed to Mirkarimi on Jan. 2, 2009, shortly after their relationship ended, in which she appears to threaten to damage Mirkarimi&rsquo;s career:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>So as 2009 rolls in and you roll out<br />I remember what my life is all about<br />Surrounded by so many of my friends<br />I am rich and happy with how my story ends<br /><br />Except one thing.<br /><br /> I have never had the distinct displeasure<br />Of meeting such an idiot of such great measure<br />That freely let me know of things<br />That could unwind plans of what his political future brings<br /><br />Yes, I do know those, some of whom you hate.<br />Who could have a say in your fate.<br />And long friendships with some that you despise.<br />That after the fact have opened my eyes<br /><br />What to do with the ball in my court...<br />Let us see what happens.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Stiglich also cited inconsistencies in Flores&rsquo; statements to police. According to Stiglich, Flores said in one interview that Mirkarimi grabbed her by both arms. In another, she said he grabbed only one arm.</p>\r\n<p>Stiglich described Flores an &ldquo;eager participant in the media frenzy&rdquo; surrounding the case. After reading about the case from her home in Southern California, Flores testified that she called a Bay Area television station and asked to speak with a reporter.</p>\r\n<p>Stiglich has also filed a motion to move the trial to a different county, arguing that the extensive media coverage of the case has prevented Mirkarimi's ability to get a fair trial.</p>\r\n<p>Wong has not yet ruled on those motions, but on Friday afternoon, he ruled that Nancy Lemon, a lecturer at Berkeley Law, could testify as an&nbsp;expert witness during the trial. Lemon has has helped write state laws on domestic violence and has written a legal textbook on the subject.&nbsp;Prosecutors want to use her testimony to show that Lopez's behavior after the alleged incident is consistent with \"intimate partner battery\" and its effects on victims.</p>\r\n<p>In court Friday, Lemon testified that it was very common for victims of domestic violence to minimize or recant allegations, and that victims of abusers with prominent positions in society are even less likely to come forward. Speaking in general, rather than about the Mirkarimi case in&nbsp;particular, she said it was common for victims to avoid telling the police.</p>\r\n<p>\"In my experience, victims of abuse are more likely to tell someone who is close to them, whether that is a family member or neighbor or friend, than to tell someone in authority,\" Lemon said.</p>\r\n<p>Jury selection will continue Monday morning, when 144 prospective jurors will be questioned by prosecutors and defense attorneys.</p>\r\n<p><em>Ryan Jacobs contributed reporting.</em></p>", "slug": "jury-can-see-eliana-lopez-video", "title": "Jury Can See Eliana Lopez Video"}}, {"pk": 13753, "model": "content.story", "fields": {"body": "<p>A California lawmaker is calling for the state's private vocational schools to be more transparent about their accreditation status and the quality of the degrees they offer.</p>\r\n<p>Assemblyman Marty Block (D-San Diego), chairman of the Assembly Higher Education Committee, has written legislation requiring vocational schools that offer associate, bachelor's and master's degrees to disclose in their course catalogs whether they are accredited, and if their degrees carry limited value.</p>\r\n<p>About 400,000 students attend such schools across the state.</p>\r\n<p>Block introduced his bill on Feb. 24 after reading <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/education/story/vocational-schools-complaints-mount-lags/\" target=\"_blank\">a series</a> <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/education/story/state-shut-down-medical-institute/\" target=\"_blank\">of articles</a> <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/education/story/enforcement-chief-postsecondary-bureau/\" target=\"_blank\">by The Bay Citizen</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/education/story/california-leads-nation-unaccredited/\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> that California had allowed many unaccredited vocational schools to operate for decades without legally required inspections or evaluations of educational quality.</p>\r\n<p>The Bay Citizen's investigation also found that the state agency responsible for oversight, the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, had accumulated a backlog of about 200 investigations into complaints against schools.

This may seem like a surprising move for someone who graduated from Cornell University with a degree in English, but it has led to a singular career.</p>\r\n<p>Ullman, a native of New York who has lived in San Francisco for several decades, went on to write two explicitly technology-related books &mdash; a memoir and a novel &mdash; as well as many essays and nonfiction articles on human-computer interaction.</p>\r\n<p>Compared with her early work, Ullman&rsquo;s much-praised new novel, &ldquo;By Blood,&rdquo; seems conspicuously, almost defiantly traditional.</p>\r\n<p>A psychological thriller set in gritty 1970s San Francisco, with a classics professor for a protagonist and other characters connected by family and fate to the Holocaust, it dwells within a world where personal computers do not even exist.</p>\r\n<p>Ullman, at her loft in the South of Market neighborhood in San Francisco, where she has lived for 16 years, said the evolution of her work was her way of moving on.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Some people hit a profession and just keep going deeper into it, making a life and making it more and more stable,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not been my experience. I always want to try something new.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>New editions of Ullman&rsquo;s two previous books, each with introductions by big names in literature and technology &mdash; Mary Gaitskill, a fiction writer, and Jaron Lanier, a Berkeley-based Web prognosticator and the author of &ldquo;You Are Not a Gadget&rdquo; &mdash; are being rereleased simultaneously with the publication of &ldquo;By Blood.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>%related%</p>\r\n<p>Ullman started programming computers because of an interest in early video photography. She said she had wanted to explore. &ldquo;Like: This is a cool machine. What can you do with it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was just fascinated by it. I loved when I got something to work.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, she said, &ldquo;I needed to earn a living.&rdquo; At that time, programming jobs were plentiful even for people like her, who lacked computer science degrees.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, however, she said she found programming &ldquo;jittery.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking to defined interfaces, not making up a whole world,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;With code, what it means is what it does. It doesn&rsquo;t express, not really. It&rsquo;s a very bounded conversation. And writing is not bounded. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s hard about it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In recent years she has preferred to strive for fluency with literary language rather than computer code. Even so, the new editions of Ullman&rsquo;s previous books come bearing tech-focused cover designs: a USB cable as fork-tongued serpent, a desktop mouse as hollow-eyed skull.</p>\r\n<p>Ullman&rsquo;s first book, &ldquo;Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents,&rdquo; was originally published in 1997 by City Lights. In his introduction to the new edition, Lanier called it &ldquo;a remarkable document that is both the best account of the intimate experience of computation by a person and a saved slice of historical memory, of that almost lost moment before everything went digitally nuts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Gaitskill, in her introduction to Ullman&rsquo;s first novel, &ldquo;The Bug,&rdquo; which is set in a Silicon Valley start-up in the 1980s, likened it to Nikolai Gogol&rsquo;s short story &ldquo;The Overcoat,&rdquo; from 1842.

After an ambiguous departure from the university, the professor character takes a downtown office to attend to his work, but instead becomes obsessed with listening in on next-door conversation between a therapist and her patient. What follows is a vortex of identity crises, troubled histories, and grappling with, as Ullman writes, &ldquo;the clammy hand of ancestry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>While the action of Ullman&rsquo;s new book is set pre-Internet, it still resonates deeply with the virtual way we live now. The narrator&rsquo;s account of his eavesdropping &mdash; &ldquo;How odd it was to know such intimate details about a person&rsquo;s life yet have no context in which to place them&rdquo; &mdash; could describe the experience of reading strangers&rsquo; feeds on Facebook or Twitter.</p>\r\n<p>The appeal of Ullman&rsquo;s work is in that juxtaposition, said Sean McDonald, her editor at Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux in New York. &ldquo;She combines, in unexpected ways, a distinct sense of immediacy and cultural currency &mdash; of nowness &mdash; with old-fashioned, Old World atmosphere and storytelling,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>Oscar Villalon, managing editor of the local literary journal Zyzzyva, a sponsor of a reading by Ullman and Lanier at Dalloway&rsquo;s Bookstore in Berkeley later this month, echoed that thought. &ldquo;I still recall her fine piece on Linux versus Windows,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In theory, you might not have cared a bit about that sort of thing, but her writing brings out concerns about values, making you see implications you would have otherwise been ignorant of.&rdquo; (The Bay Citizen is also a sponsor of the reading.)</p>\r\n<p>For Ullman, understanding the power of technology does not negate the value of narrative. &ldquo;I think storytelling in general is how we really deeply know things,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ancient.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><em>This article also appears in the Bay Area edition of The New York Times. </em></p>", "slug": "programmer-turned-novelist-recalls-era", "title": "Programmer-Turned-Novelist Recalls an Era before Computers"}}]
